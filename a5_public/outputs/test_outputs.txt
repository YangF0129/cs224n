You know what I do, you know what I do is to write for kids, ,, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist . . . .
I can look like a farmer, , or a leather clothing, , and nobody has ever chosen a farmer.
Today I'm here to talk to you about circles and epidemics.
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell somewhere.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as an epidemic.
That's a picture of a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollower.
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the 1960s in the high school, in Stewart, Ohio where I was the right of the class.
When they were hitting every week in the children's bathroom, until a saved my life.
She saved my life to allow me to enter the teacher's bathroom.
I did it in secret.
For three.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the 1980s, I the need to start working in organizations that fought AIDS.
About three or four years ago, halfway, I received a phone call of that teacher, the lady Poster he said, , I, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I'm disillusioned that adults never come to know us.
You could come to Ohio, and please bring to that man I know you've already found.
And I have to say I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to be able to do this please . ''
Well, the next day we in Cleveland.
We went to see it, we laughed, we, and we realized that she needed to be customized.
And we found it a place, we tried it, and we took care of it, and we got to their family, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to meet as an adult came to meet, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epidemic that I talked about it was made in itself . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The epidemic is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I went out.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today was talked about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I, I'm trying to express that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, , and I saw my first traits.
I was astounded . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
My heart, fast, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So the training around me about 60 meters, almost 60 meters, and I couldn't even think that it was a snowball about another kind of snow year after year.
The roofs are born when they're getting away from glaciers, or they break the ice barriers.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them will refuse to surrender and melt up to the end, whereas others can't support them more and melt in a dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a iceberg, that are isolated separate and only, as as much as we see ourselves as humans.
But reality is all the opposite.
As a iceberg is melting, , ,.
As a computer is melts fresh water freshwater in minerals that feeds a lot of life.
I'm approached to photograph these things as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and won't be going back that way again.
It's not the death when they melt; it's not a end, ,, in the cycle of life.
Part of the iceberg of the that I photograph is a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are a iceberg that I photographed in Ketraps, Greenland.
It's a little bit prevalent to really get to a radical iceberg . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Here you have.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And I'd like you to pay attention to the form of the iceberg and your floating line.
You can see here, it starts to roll, the boat has moved down to the other side, and the man is there.
This is a Greenland iceberg, average size.
It's about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so now, the iceberg shows a different side of their personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, , every single one of a baby.
So two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to stop too much in the details of the conception, because if you stop thinking about conception itself, you're not going to pay me attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, , I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and of the sperm joined the X chromosome of flight.
And in the other case, the the X chromosome of sperm joined the X chromosome of flight.
Both of them think about and start life.
Let's talk about them later.
In my field activity, I'm going to fulfill two roles.
In one of my roles, , work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a training historian, and what I study in this case is the way people tackle anatomy -- -- to say, of human and animals, how they've considered body fluids, the idea of the body, what they have thought about body . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The other role I witnessed in my work is an activist, as patients advocate or, as I say sometimes, impossible advocate of people who are doctors.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with twin twins, two people within a same body.
I've worked with people with emissions -- people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with athletic sex, individuals whose physical theology doesn't fit in the male schemes and female schemes.
In general lines, we can call it international.
The interconnections adopted many shapes.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that doesn't be wrong in male or female commons.
So for instance, there's the case of the individual computer bill, whose KR gene of the chromosome, and it tells ProtonMail, that we all have in the fetal life, that they become testicles.
And then in the fatal life, the testes produce testosterone.
But given that this individual acts of testosterone receptors, , the body doesn't react to the itself . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's the sensitivity syndrome.
So there are high levels of testosterone, but no reaction.
As a result, the body develops by following a typically female course.
When it's born, the baby has a child's aspects . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's a a girl . It's raised as a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And often it's not it, but to puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breasts, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
After making them tests, you realize that instead of having ovaries and uterus, it actually has testicles and a chromosome . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called supermarket glands.
They are in the back in the body . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Super glands produce anger, marketing hormone.
Most women like me -- -- I consider a typical woman; it doesn't know its chemical structure; -- I, ,, most women as I are sensitive to animals.
We produced anger, and we respond to angle.
As a result, someone like me has the the most exposed brain to the heartbreak that the woman who was born with testicles that has the inferiority syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing . It's not that investors are in the middle of the -- in a way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I received a call from a 19 boy born, and raised as you vary; I had bride, ,, and sexual relationships with her, ,, ,, and I just discovered that he had ovaries and uterus.
I had an extreme form of a, which is known as frozen super-controlling hyperglycemia.
It had 20th chromosomes, and in the uterus, the sustainable glands were so active that essentially they created a male hormone environment.
As a result, their genitals were multiplied, ,, was exposed to the typically male component.
I was born with a child, no one suspects anything.
And in the age of the age of 19, when he started having medical problems caused by internal manufacturing, when doctors discovered that, in fact, he was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of an international case.
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what's known as obvious, that is, they have the heroic tissue wrapped in tissue tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So there's a lot of sex.
The reason why kids with these kind of bodies -- -- -- they're finance, twin twins, or international surgery, is not to be able to fight a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they are subjected to several surgeries is that they are a threat for our social categories.
The system normally is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We have the idea that being female is to to have female identity -- supposedly, to be black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
It's a terribly simplistic idea . . .
And when you introduce a body that shows something pretty different, we have problems with category.
So we have very romantic ideas in our in our culture.
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic individuals.
Imagine how surprising it is to have children who are born as two people within a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The most logical case is last year with South Africa Cart Sea; ; he stood on his sex, his sex in the Berlin International games.
Many journalists called to ask me,``What do you test to do to determining if Casey semen is a man or woman? ''
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such an exam.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't bring a line between men and women or between men and interviews and women and investors; we are us who we do that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more advanced science, the more we have to admit that these categories, that we thought were stable academic categories that are running directly with stable identical categories -- are much more difficult than we thought.
And just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that's much more complicated than terminology allows.
As we see, we get into a wonderful terrain.
Let's look, for instance, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What would we think of the fact to differ from them in just a few nucleotides??????????????????????????????????????????????????????
And as we progress in science, we get more and more in an uncomfortable area in which we have to recognize that the simplistic categories that we have probably are too simplistic.
And we're looking at this in all the realms of human life.
One of them, for example, in our in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to a moment from which a body gets human and has different rights than the fetus.
There are very hidden discussions today -- not in public, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Our ancestors never had to fly to this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of people put a in front of the nose, and if they moved they still didn't get it.
If I stopped moving they buried.
But today we can, for instance, extract vital organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we need to face the dilemma to really determine someone's death, and this puts us into a that we do don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this categories explosion could smell somebody like me . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In politics, I'm a progressive, defending people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
It will consider that these categories are much more unstable than we thought about it.
So tension from the concept of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I am a fan lady from the founding parents.
I know they were racist, I know they were sexist, but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold, and so radical in what they did, that I find each so much watching that musical cure,``1777 ,"and not the music, which is totally pressure . .
That's what happened in 1776 with the founding parents . .
The founding parents were, for me, the first activists of anatomy and explained why . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What they refuse was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another that was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And, like everybody remember, what we did is our refused our parents, the idea of monarchy, the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
Old world monarchs didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth right.
They had the concept of blue blue.
They were from the idea that it came to the political power for the right of blood the grandfather to father and then the son, etc.
The founding parents rejected that idea and replaced for a new analog concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They leveled the game field and decided that anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not analytical differences . That was something very radical.
And in part of it, they were doing it because they were part of an island system where two things were being spent.
The democracy was being spent and at the same time.
And, it's very clear, if we look at the history of the founding parents, that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a natural world . .
They were getting away from supernatural explanations, and therefore they reject the concept of supernatural power that is transmitted by a very right idea of birth right.
They were moving into a natural concept.
And if we look at, for example, the Declaration of Independence, they talk about nature and of nature.
They don't talk about God and from God.
They talk about nature's power to tell us who we are.
And in fact, they were transferred to the idea of analytical coincidence.
And by doing that, they were feeling the foundations of the Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think about it that way, but they did it for us and was great.
And what about years later?
And women triumph.
And then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement of the Civil Rights movement with people in the warming of South Troy, who said,``Am I a? . .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying,``I'm a man . ''
Again, people of color who appealed to analytical coincidence about analytical difference, and again, they succeeded.
We see the same with the disability movement.
The problem is, of of course, that as we look at the coincidence, we have to start asking why we keep questions.
But, attention, I want to keep some anatomic divisions in our culture . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For instance, I, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should give up in anatomy.
I don't mean that the five-year-old kids should be allowed to have sexual relationships or marry.
There are some anatomy divisions that make sense of me and I think we should keep.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep it and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two conceived ones at the beginning of this talk . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We have two beings, both of them in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time, June 1.
Henry, on the contrary, was born in terms: I was born the one of March 1980.
By the way, I was born three months before Mary, all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all of that not because he has a different biological age, but because he was born after.
We found other rules in relationship to their rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- -- I haven't told you if it it's XL, in virtue of being considered a man now is possible for the mandatory enricher that Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary, , it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states ,.
Henry can marry in all states with a woman, but Mary can marry with a woman just in some states.
So they still persistent anatomy categories that in various ways are problematic and questionable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Now the question is: What do we do now that science advances so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to to admit that a base democracy in anatomy could break?
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time, , sometimes I feel like science is escape.
Where are we going?
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitude:``Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we going to . ''
But a lot of people are stuck in a a.
For example, Texas at at a time has decided that to marrying a, ,, and that to marry with a woman, you have to chromosomes.
Now, in practice they don't do chemical exams to people.
But this is also very strange as the story that I told you at the beginning of the inferimative syndrome.
So if you look at one of the of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech,``I"speech, it offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people, we should be based on the color of their skin, but in the content of their character ,"going beyond anatomy.
And I mean,``Yeah, the idea seems very good . ''
But in practice, how does it do?
How do you judge people based on your character.
I also want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be based on this to ensure people right, because I have to admit that I know about some of the to be able to deserve the social services than some human services I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the speakers that I know can make more informed, intelligent and mature decisions about their sexual relationships than 40 I know.
So how do you put to practice the issue of the character content?
It's very hard.
And one part of me wonder what happens if a person's character could be measured with an instrument, perhaps with a magnetic resonance.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States continues to guide this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in democracy, and I think we will do a good work in the future . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We don't live, for example, in a context like the anger in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed, ,, unless he's willing to to a, ,, . . ., . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made a, and then separate them, and that will increase her fame.
But when the phones, I asked the, the was a very risky operation, and it responded to me that in that other country, these children would be very bad, and then he had to . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And I said,``Well, has the political asylum instead of surgical separation? ''
The United States offers enormous possibilities to people to be who are without forcing them to change for the right of the state.
So I think we have to be to head.
Well, to finish, I mean I've been talking a lot about parents.
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it could have been, if we had given greater participation to mothers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And I mean something a little radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there can be different ideas from different analog typical types, in particular if there are people thinking about groups . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For years, since I've been interested in international, I've also been interested in researching the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operating in the world.
And what we know about the cross-cultural studies is that women, on average -- not all, but in average they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to occupy those who are vulnerable within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in the graduate, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminism -- I was considered feminist, like now made a strange plant.
\" Tell me what of female feminism . ''
And I thought,``It's the most silly question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with getting gender stereotypes, so there's nothing female in feminism . ''
But the more I've thought about his question, the more like there's something female in feminism.
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more attacks to complex social relationships and willing to help the vulnerable.
So, if parents were very keen to finding how to protect people from the state of the state, it's possible that, to having injected more mothers in this concept, maybe we'd have enriched the concept of protection with a reciprocal support . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And perhaps that is what we have to do in the future when we bring democracy beyond anatomy: thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect universe, think about what we do for the other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where to go live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, we are far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with one city willing to get them.
But the surprising thing about cities is that they value much more than their construction cost.
So easily we could deliver it to the world, perhaps hundreds, in new cities.
Well, this can sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But just replace it by apartment buildings.
Imagine that half of those people who wanted to live in apartment, they were already owned, and the other half would still fail to do it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They could try to increase the ability by making applications in all existing buildings.
But you know the problem that you face is that the buildings and the areas around them have rules to avoid the discomfort and the construction.
So it would be very hard to to do all those things.
But they could go to a, building a whole new apartment building, always, and when the rules of that place facilitate construction instead of putting it.
So I proposed that governments create new enough reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name: completely underground cities.
I later learned that more or less at the same time, Mahus and Ottawa were thinking about the the reflective.
They knew that every year about 25,000 hours would come out of their country to to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask to ask us what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those things in Honduras . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the summer of 2009 Honduras went through a heartbreaking constitutional crisis.
In the next regular elections, Loui Louis is unfortunately imposed with a platform in which I promise reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
I asked October to be his chief chief.
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of perfection, trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under status to its most essential ideas.
And the first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that they say you can't go and bother all of the current apartments of apartment.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, ,, but it's needed so much of technologies like rules to progress, and it's usually the rules that are prevented by us.
In 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to eighth a TEDTalk.
I showed it to Java . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They call me.
They said,``Let me introduce the leaders of our country . ''
So in December, we met in Miami, in a conference room.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their monetary cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York . Let's look at it, the terrain, that, in some cases, is thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, Ottawa said,``Paul, maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk talk . talk . talk . talk . talk . talk . talk . talk . talk . talk . talk . talk . talk . talk . talk . talk . talk . talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a low city is a place where it starts with devices, a state that specialized the rules that are going to be applied there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not to live under those rules.
So the president of Honduras called me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the to be the way for our advanced country.
He asked me to to go to Lego and talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to get a lot value to a city, has to be very large.
This is a picture of Denver and the white line is the new airport that was built in Denver.
Only this airport covers over 100 square kilometers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So I was trying to convince the honor that to build a new city, , you have to start with a site that measures at least 1,000 square kilometers.
That's over 100,000 acres.
The whole world applied.
The public faces were very serious and affordable.
The leader leader came to the platform and said,``Professor Rome, thank you very much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk talk.
I have here in my computer . ''
So I sat and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained the essential thing, that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option of a that might be in Honduras, rather than hundreds of miles away from distance north.
And it also includes new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the Honduras government needed help help from associated countries, they could benefit from associated countries that would help them establish and make the status of the status, so everyone could trust the status that the status effectively is.
We went and saw a site . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This picture is from there.
It could be about a thousand square kilometers.
And shortly after January 19, they voted in Congress to start their Constitution and add a constitutional device that allows us to create these special regions of development.
In a country that just passed through this painful crisis, voting in Congress, in favor of this constitutional amendment was 1.2 to one.
All the parties, all of society in society, would breathe.
To include in the Constitution, it has to be approved twice in Congress.
The 17th of February was approved again in another voting, from 14 to one.
Immediately after voting, of 21 to 24 of February, a deployment of about 30 hours was to the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in cities.
One of the South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big core in the city that is being built in South Korea; it's larger than Boston's center . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
All you see there was built in four years after they spent four years getting permission.
The other interested country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're thinking about a for the second.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators to come, and would allow them to operate under an outer legal system.
A country has already committed to allow their Supreme Court to is the the last point for this new judicial system.
There are urban urban buildings that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing that we know is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that would want to install in the Americas, especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world, there are 700 million people who say they'd like to be changing immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to going to get a job; sometimes they are single mothers that have to money to just eating or to to buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even children who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in Honduras?
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to think about insist that families can choose between several cities that are competing to attract new residents?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my honest friends asked me to say,``Thank you TED . ''
I'm Jesse, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But before I show you what there is inside, ,, I, ,, ,, . .
I love to find, to see, and more recently, photograph and publish in my blog suits, , colorful and different for every occasion.
But didn't buy anything new.
All my clothing is a second hand of thumb markets and secondhand stores.
Ah, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The second hand of the second hand allows me to reduce my jaw's impact in the environment and in my wallet.
I'm going to meet people who are interesting -- usually my money goes to a good cause; my point is unique, and buying becomes my personal search for treasures.
I mean, what am I going to find today??.
Is it going to be my talk? ''
I like color?
Do you cost less than 20 dollars?
If all answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
And I'm going back to the theme of my vagina, I want to tell you what I packed for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does someone have all that clothing?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
Now, the interior clothes for exactly a week is all I I put in my vagina.
I imagine it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after getting here to Palm Springs.
And because they don't known me as the woman who walks for TED in inner clothes, that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the tools for this week.
Isn't it interesting?
As I do, I, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, to believe it or not, ,, , ,.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is called brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost be seen at least 50 dollars.
All the whole thing, including the jacket, took me 55, is the most expensive I've ever used in the week.
Monday: color is energy.
It's almost physically impossible to being bad mood, when you're seeing a brilliant red display.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people . . .
Mars: interview.
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you're surrounded by the, you're not just going to understand yourself, you'll also appreciate you.
Wednesday: Great of the child you carry inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it looks like I play the predictions, or I remind you to your little seven years.
I like to suggest and say,``Thank you . ''
Folks: trust is key.
If you think you're good at something, it almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see anything well, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But it wasn't until the 30 years really understood its meaning.
I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, ,, you can't get caught.
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
Friday: A universal truth six words for you: , the the golden twins go with everything.
And finally, Saturday: develop a personal style of yourself and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people came to me this week just what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all of this is not going to enter my little altruism.
So before I go home, to Brooklyn, I to donated everything . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to leave some things.
I don't need to get stuck emotionally to these things, because around the corner of the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, colorful and brilliant, if there's a little love in my heart and search . . .
Thank you.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic part, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if we used a scale to measure the attitude of every hemisphere, we could design a plane of our our brains.
For instance, this would be somebody who is completely logical . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So where would you turn your brain on this scale?? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?
Some of them would opt through one of these extremes, but I think for most of the ingredients in this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great attitude in both hemisphere at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually exclusive.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider one of those people, that just like most other experimental quantum physicists, we need pretty logical to connect these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this intuition? Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them and then we see how they react, and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
Now, some intuition that you can have developed over the years is the one that says that one thing can be just in one place at once.
I mean, it can sound weird to think that one is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion, you develop.
I remember observing a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a, and didn't do it very well, it always falls.
But I bet that play with that parking bar, teaches him a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow us to travel, and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have from the world, except you are a.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't playing parking bars, play with these strange little particles.
And when you play with your particles, you discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like you can go through walls, or you can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it quantum mechanics theory . .
At that point, it was the physics a few years ago; you need quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But it didn't need to describe the big things around us every day.
That didn't work very well in my intuition, and maybe it not play very often.
Well sometimes I play with it, but not much.
And have never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a particle.
But it didn't have a good deal with my logic part.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it should not all follow the principles of quantum mechanics?
I don't find the reason that it shouldn't.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in a superconductor of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the a piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to extend it a little bit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And then we're doing a good big approach to the little bit of a third metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal metal, with transformation, and it's going to be supported in a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would have a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I, I had to build my own machine -- to make this vent ship shape of swimming swimming underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum assumption, but for it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator, I, I do all sorts of weird things, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Quantum mechanics says inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The travels of inanimate objects are not just people, ,, it's also the light that shines it and the wind that goes on their side and heat.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to explode all other passengers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And that was what we did . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We went through the lights, then we introduced a vacuum and we extracted all the air, and then we're cooling it to a temperature of less than a degree of the absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the elevator, the little piece of metal is free to act as you want . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So we measure their motions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We discovered that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly, I was vibrating ., ,, ,, ,, ,, as a expands and contract.
And by giving it a soft push, we could make it vibrate and don't vibrate at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a vibrating thing and not the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case: all of the billions of atoms that consume that piece of metal, and at the same time that same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in a certain moment when those are aligned.
In the rest of the time they are located.
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means is that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
It was worth to lock me in a clean room to do this for all those of those years, ,, ,, , because, look at this, the scale difference between one atoms and that metal of metal is kind of the same as the difference between that metal and and you.
So if one single atoms can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal of metal can be in two different places, why don't you also?
I mean, it's my logical part that speaks.
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time, how would it be?? .? . .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?
How do you act your awareness if your body was declining in space?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
There's another part of history.
And it's when we heat it, and we turn the lights out and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all objects in the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just made in a.
You hear a lot about quantum mechanics that you're interconnected.
Well that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surrounded you, literally define who you are, and that is the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics . mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is Amitabha . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And 18 months ago, I did another work at Google, until he launched the, ,, ,, , and I, and art, which is here and allowed me to take it out.
It took me 18 months.
Many negotiations and stories, you make sure, with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on demo.
There are lots of stories of why we did it.
I think my own story is simply explained in this slide, and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I was a Google of a great education -- I wasn't complaining, but it didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
And so when I started traveling and going to museums, , I started learning a lot.
And working at Google, , I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a, and we started doing it.
I better show you the demo to then explain a couple of interesting things that we've taken from their launch.
So just: we go to Googler.
Look around all the museums there.
There's the Force Gallery, ,, ,, ,, , Google . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I actually go into one of my favorites, to Metropolitan, Art Museum.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We click and, Pam! We, we are in the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, Bombay or Mexico, ,.
You move around and fun.
Do you want to navigate the?
We open up the flat top, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They're inside, , they want to go at the end of the . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Keep forward . It's fun!
Explorer . . . . .
Thank you, but I haven't reached the better.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings,``The Cocaros"by Peter Breaken in Metropolitan.
I see the sign.
If the museum shows the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Here's all the metadata information.
For those of you who are truly interested in art, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the limited technology . .
So this image, for example, contains, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me,``What do you get with 10,000 million pixels? ''
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It can make a zoo around very simple way . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this kid, his expression has no price.
But if you really wish to delve.
So I started playing, and I met something that happens there.
And I said,``A moment, this seems interesting . ''
I entered and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I was researching a little bit, I talked to some people from the Metropolitan, and actually discovered that this is a game called [unclear], which is to hitting an ear with a the Tuesday Tuesday . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper in deep and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take away the image, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Here is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So now we're going to quickly jump to MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites,``The Strand night . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the penguins?
And if you want to see how Dan Gogh actually created this masterpiece?
It increases it, and it really does.
I go to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is``the night ,"I, I I had never seen before.
I'm going to show you another of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really cool . It's called``collections . ''
All of you, absolutely all, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a mansion, that day.
You can online your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, , we enter -- I've created this function that I call``The power of the Pot ,"-- we just made a zoo around.
It's about``The ambassadors ,"in London National Gallery.
You can do things, send it to your friends and maintain a conversation about what you feel when you're contemplating these masterpieces.
So in conclusion, I, the main thing is that all incredible things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, , even not from museums.
Maybe I should not say this . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium, I hope to your artwork, and it's properly represented online.
And the big question I'm doing today is: ,, to repeating the experience of going to a museum? .? . . .? . . .? . . .? . .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?.
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's all . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a pixel, a . .
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am Italian, all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of your bedroom, but the reason I show you this is that something very interesting happened in Formula 1 in the last two decades.
So a while ago, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, ,, ,, ,, ,, a good pilot.
And if car and the, the's enough enough, you win the race.
This is what, in engineering, is called a real-time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two components: a sensor and an accident . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What's interesting today is that the real-time control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They're becoming computer outdoors.
And like such, they're starting to respond differently and they can be detected and accepted.
By addition cities is big.
As I noticed it, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the energy consumption -- and 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it something big.
Beyond cities, all these things and activation are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of Day Anamali for weekends in MoMA, during summer.
It's called``Talk uncle Me Me . ''
Well, our objects, the environment, start talking to us.
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms became sensors and actuators.
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outer environment.
In a sense, it almost like in the old dream of Michelangelo.
You know, when Miguel angel sculpted the Moses, he's said that at the end of the hammer, and I added it to the Moses -- you can still see a little bit below and said,``Well, don't you pay it? ''
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to talk about.
And I'm going to show you just a few examples, insisting in the idea of capturing environment and achieving something.
Let me start with sensing.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer summer in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup.
Maybe some of you remember it, you played Italy and France, and at the end of the CEO gave the head.
And anyway, at the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day observing activity happened in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the collision in the middle and the River.
It's the morning before play . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The time line is at the top.
The early afternoon there are people over here, and they're doing calls, moving.
It starts the: : . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
France of France . Gold from Italy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Station; people do a quickly and goes to the bathroom.
Second time . End time.
First extra time; second.
Zero, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Win Italy, yeah! . .
That night, everybody was to celebrate the center.
So there's the big peak.
The next day, they were all at the the the the the center of the winning team and the first minister of then.
And then everyone came down . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You see the image of the place called City Museum, where, from the Roman time, people will celebrate; it a great party, , the the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another example of detection: it's not people, but of things we use and we use.
Today we know all about the procedure of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that ate a Mac, how they assemble.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed a little bit of small tags to track the trash in its deployments.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a few more than a year ago, to tag what they were running out of -- different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all of us would throw out.
And then we put a little chip, a tag, to the trash, and then we started tracking it.
These are the results.
From Seattle ...
So after a week.
With this information, we realized that there are many inefficient in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
There are complicated things happening and there's a lot of unnecessary transport.
But the other thing that we believe is that if we see every day that the cup that we love doesn't disappear, which is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we throw a day still still follow there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some behavior change.
That was the reason the project.
My colleague at MIT, Asia Birracology, , could tell us much more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we mentioned at the beginning, which is to get to the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zambia.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the water use in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, will join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was: imagine that they have a chaos and valves, solid valves, stickers that open up and closed.
It's created as a water curtain, with pixels of water.
If you fall the pixels, you can write about them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when we zoom up, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We presented this to Mayor Mayor.
He liked it.
It's a commission to design the building to the entrance of the expo.
We call it digital Water Panic.
All the building is made of water.
There's no door, no windows, but when you approach it, it opens up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered of water . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And if there's a little wind, if you want to minimize the sulfates, it goes down the ceiling . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Or you can close the building and all architecture disappears, like in this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when they go down the roof, someone who was there and said,``Give the the building . ''
No, it's not that they have been demolished, but when it goes down almost all architecture disappears.
Here it is working.
You see people intrigued by what happens inside.
And here I am trying not to move by testing the sensors that open water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All of the children in Zambia came to the building because the way of interacting had changed a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It was no longer a building that was open to let go on, but a building that kept running cuts and water holes and you had to jump to don't move.
( People of people) And for us that was very interesting because as architects, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, we think about the use that people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact, people use . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels, water pixels, and projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that pixels could start flying.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air, and each one had a that changes color as a that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, that moves with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud.
Sort of flexible screen like this with normal configurations in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of pixels.
You can play with a different kind.
Imagine that screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a pictures of pixels in 3D that you can go on and go through, and see from very diverse angles.
This is the truly controlled Florida, going down to form a V, ,, . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . . ., . ., . . . . .
When light is released, you see this . The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have every pixel with an input that comes from people, and so on, etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with Robert Bolt, one of the the best ballet dancers of today, the Methon Metronome in New York City and to capture their 3D movements and use it as interviewed for Plaus.
Here we can see Robert dancing.
On the left you see the pixels, the capture in different resolutions.
It's so much 3D digitization in real time as motion capture.
It can rebuild all the movement.
You can turn all the.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and motion, with gravity and rotation.
We want to use this as a possible entry for the Plext . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for London Olympics.
It's called El Cloud . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to to do something and change our environment -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- like a clothing of clouds like the grain of grain, but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everyone donated a little bit for a pixel . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and accessible through the Internet . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Today, for the first time -- the Obama campaign showed us, we can go from the digital world, the self-organizing power of networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may want to use it to design and make a symbol.
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions . emissions to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, collectively.
The cloud is a cloud, again, of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas our are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, , but covered pixels.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from below, to serve to share the main moments of the 2016 Olympics and even more, and can be used as a form of connection with community.
So, it's so much a physical cloud in the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can get there.
As if it was a digital forum at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than you are?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve memory -- for more accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you'd like to better, to be stronger, to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure of yourself???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
How about good health?
Or maybe they are from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What would you like?
What would you like, if you could choose something?
( Audience member: creativity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
How many people choose creativity?
Raise your hand . Let me see.
A few . Probably, it was a number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state?
A little bit less.
What about longevity?
Ah, . That makes me feel very well like doctor.
If you could have something that the world would be very different.
Is it just imagination? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Or maybe it possible?
Evolution has been a personal theme here at the TED Conference, but I want to give you a doctor's view of a doctor.
The great genealogy of the 20th century, T. . Dobress, which also drove up in the Orbetted Church Russian, wrote a titled trial,``Nothing in biology makes sense to evolution . ''
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: is it just about the past, or the future?
Does it mean others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at on an extreme, is, of, of course, the most interesting one.
We die from a common ancestor with modern chimps about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 different species of hominids.
Some have gone and forth.
We've been here about 30,000 years.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is kind of the same.
Do you realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat diabetes?
This is not the human insulin; it's the same protein, chemically independent, that it comes out of the pancreas.
And talking about bacteria -- do you realize that we're all in the more bacteria that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio Damasio raises what's about autonomy -- think of bacteria?
The gut is a wonderfully hospital environment for those bacteria . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's warm, , dark, wet, is very high.
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want without the effort of your part.
It's really like a quick one for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some fancy water to the . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But therefore, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They help digest essential nutrients, and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the?
Are we in kind of evolutionary balance as a species? . .
Or are we destined to become something different, something perhaps better adapted to the environment?
In this very inclusive symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief computer, the animal kingdom, as one and only, ,, , and human life, a a . . . .
That was us . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And it was also the entertaining part of this talk, so I hope you've been enjoying it.
When I was in college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental: in most of the existence of life, in the single-celled organism, every cell is simply split and all the genetic energy of that cell to two daughters.
But when multicellular organisms appear, things start changing.
It enters the sexual reproduction.
And something very important: with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes predictable.
In fact, you could say that the inevitability of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a university student, I, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , it seemed pretty reasonable at at that time, but every year I had more doubt.
I got to understand George Burns feelings, who still acted in Las Vegas in his 90s.
And one night, someone hit your hotel door . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He opens the door.
In front of him, he finds a magnificent light of clothing.
He looks at it and says,``Come on for a``sex soup . ''
\" Okay ,"he says George,``I choose the soup . ''
I realized, as a doctor, that I was working by a different goal at the goal of evolution -- not necessarily, just different . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I was trying to preserve the body . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I wanted us to healthy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I wanted to recover health in disease . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I wanted us to live more and healthier.
Evolution is to pass genome to the next generation, adapting and survival generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are as a refugee rocket that is designed to send the genetic burden to the next orbital level and then let the sea the sea.
I think we would all understand the feeling that Woody Allen expressed when he said,``I don't want to get immortality through my work . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I want to make it not dying . ''
Evolution doesn't necessarily favor longevity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or strongest or faster or even the smartest.
Evolution favors creatures better adapted to their environment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
That's the only and success trial.
In the ocean background, the terrific bacteria that can survive the heat of the smoking that we can survive, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . .
So what does this mean, when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward, to the next phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first is that we don't evolve.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, in first, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise have been discarded and eliminated from population.
And secondly, as a species, we have confused our environment to adapt to us as we adapt to it.
And, by the way, we migrate, we're closed, and we, and we, and so much that it's no longer possible to have the that evolution is necessary.
A second possibility is that it's produced an evolution of traditional, natural kind, imposed by the forces of nature . . . . . . .
And the argument here would be: that evolution of the evolution of evolution, but they are unstable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And in terms of isolation: when as a species, we have a different planets that are going to exist, and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, an attractive, intriguing and frightening possibility . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The so-called Newtonian call, the new evolution, which is not simply natural -- but it and on and selected by us as individuals in decisions that we'll take.
Now, how could this happen??.
How could we do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more viruses than women . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what it chooses in individual and familiar level.
So think also that if it could be, if it could be could be could be able to choose, not just the sex of their offspring, but in their own body to do genetic adjustments to cure or prevent diseases.
What if we could do genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer or to reduce cancer risk or eliminate the support?
Don't they want to make those changes in their genes?
If you look at the that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and 13.
It cost 2.7 million dollars . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The next year, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome to a cost close to 20,000 dollars and a week.
It won't be much to make a lot of the human genome true for $1,000 and more and more of all.
They come from those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
Believe or not there is an experimental trial in course with the vaccine against growing in cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good about tobacco?
That's reality today and in the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two little changes.
Can you change your bodies from your bodies, ,, ,, , your offspring cells?
And if they could change sperm and egg, or change the newly fertilized egg, and give their children a a a a, , to eliminate the diabetes, ,, risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want healthier children??.
And then, that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us also to adapt super hyperactivity -- a . . .
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken Jennings on everything if you could increase it with the next generation of the Watson machine?
Why not have a faster concentration muscle that allows us to run faster and more distance?
Why don't I live longer?
This is going to be.
And when we're in conditions of getting this to the next generation, and we could embrace the attributes that we want to we have turned the evolution of before in Newtonian.
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years and we can compress it to 1,000 years and maybe happened within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have.
Are we using these choices in a better, more successful society?
Or are we going to choose selectively different attributes that we want to do for some of us, but not for others?
Are we going to build a society that's more boring and more robust and more robust?????????????????????????????????????????????????????
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing: are we going to be able to develop wisdom and to inherit the wisdom required to make these decisions seriously?
For good or to bad, and before what I could think of, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you are 900 ft.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke . . . .
Imagine a motor by clicking, clear, clear.
It's clear, clear, clear, class . .
Well, , I had a single seat that day . I was sitting in the 12.
It was the only I could talk to flight assistants.
So immediately I looked at them, and they said,``There's no problem . We probably hit some birds . ''
The pilot had seen the plane, and we were not so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot releases the plane with Hudson River.
That's not the route.
I picked the motors.
Imagine being in an airplane and without noise.
And then three words said.
The three more advanced words I've heard about.
He said, for impact . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I didn't have to talk more with flight assistant . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in an instant.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get to, and I didn't, all the fence I wanted to repair, all the experiences I've wanted to have and never had.
While I was thinking about that later, ,, I came a sentence, which is,``Collaboration wine . ''
Because if wine is ready and the is there, I'm going to open it.
I don't want to spend anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
So the second thing I learned that day -- and this is as as we we were avoiding the George Washington Bridge, which wasn't a lot -- I thought, wow, wow, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve in everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also turn to my ego.
And I regret the time that you waste in things that don't matter with people who matter . . . . . . . . . . . .
And I thought about my wife, with my friends, with people . .
And then, as a measure in that, ,, , of my life.
It's not perfect, , but it much better.
In two years I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels wonderful.
It's no longer trying to be reason; Egypt will be happy.
And the third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to figure out,``15 , 14 , 13 . ''
You see the water approach.
I'm saying,``Please fly . ''
I don't want this to break in 20 pieces as you see in those documentary.
And as we went down, ,, ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's almost like we've been preparing for it all our life.
But it was very sad . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I don't want to go . I life.
And that sadness came into a single thought, which is just desire one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was in an performance of my daughter -- first grade, , not a lot of art -- still, and scream, crying, like a little.
And for me, that was the all reason to be in the world.
At that point, I understood those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For about all, the only goal I have in life is being a good parent.
I was a miracle, not to die that day.
And I got another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and come back and live in another way . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You're flying today, the challenges that you imagine that you're going on in your airplane -- and please not like this -- but imagine, and how change?
What do you do, you still hope to do because you think they're going to live forever?
How do they change their relationships and negative energy on them?
And the most important thing, are they being the best parents you can?
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many astonishing projects.
But the biggest one that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called TEDMED . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
TMM was one of the most important graffiti in the '80s . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And one day he came to his house after he ran and said,``Dad, I feel an ant on legs . ''
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today TED has a total paralysis.
You can only use your eyes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
His work influenced me . . . . . . . . . .
I have a design company and animation, so obviously, graffiti is something intricate we admire and respect in the art world.
So we decided we were going to be going to sponsor Tony, TEDWomen, and in their cause.
So I went and met his brother and her father and said,``Let's give you this money.
What will you do with it? ''
And his brother said, ,``I just want to be to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And I said,``A second, don't you see Stephen Hawking is not that all people with paralysis can communicate by those devices? ''
And he said,``No, unless you're somebody important and you have a very good, you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people . ''
And I said,``Well, how do they communicate then? ''
Anybody to see the movie``The Scholarship and the butterfly? ''
They communicate that way -- they're driving with the finger.
I said,``That's archaic . How can it be? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So I introduced myself with the just to a crash, and instead I signed up a check that had no the slightest idea how I would cover.
I'm engaged with his brother, and with her father there at that precise moment,``All right, this is the deal: Tony's going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to get it back again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who have so in their inside can't communicate . ''
So I talked about a a a couple months later.
I met these guys called``graffiti Research Lab ,"which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface, and then, with a laser pointer, draw about that and record the negative space . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that appear, they say, are part of a life cycle.
First start with sexual organs, and then with bad words, after the attacks to Bush and, at the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in your presentations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And so he started the journey . . .
And about two years later, about one year later, , after a lot organization, and so much to move things from one side to another, we had made a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of insurance companies, and we got a machine for TEDWomen to communicate, a, Hawking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most fun; I call it``Dodegue"because when you talk to the guy, you get an email email of him, and you say,``I don't deserve it . This guy is fantastic . ''
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers from around the world, in the world of all the planet corners to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, and these programs and and and and and programmers and and analogies took control of the house . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Many of our friends thought we did something completely stupid, and that when we went back, they would have taken the squares of walls and in their place would be graffiti.
But for two weeks, we went to the March's Mars, my son was part, my dog, and we created this.
It's called TEDWomen, and you can see description.
They are a couple of cheap silk glasses that we bought in Venice Beach's Mars, some copper wire and things from Homer Department and Radio Shack.
We took a PMS camera, we open it, we, we on a light of LED, and now there's a -- it's free -- we can build the software free, it goes down in free.
And we create a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says``no . ''
There's no hospital that can say``no . ''
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just their eyes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Thank you.
Thank you very much . That was awesome . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So at the end of two weeks, we went back to the TEDWomen room.
I love this picture because this is another person's room and that is their room.
There was all this billion and air for the great opening.
And then more than one year of planning, two weeks of programming, intense sessions at all, Tony came back to draw for the first in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture, because this is the support system of your life and is looking through the support system of your life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We ran her to bed so that he could see.
And we put a project on a wall of outside the hospital outside of the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in parking.
What's funny was that we had to break out in the parking, so we feel like we were choosing graffiti too.
At the end of this, he sent us an email, and this was what he said,``This was the first time I was drawing in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to rescue me, and I would take out there so I could breathe . ''
Is not wonderful?
In some form, that is our war scream . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
That's what keeps us moving, developing.
And we have a long way to go with this.
It's a equivalent.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all sorts of recognition.
We've won many prizes.
Remember, it's free; none of us is making money with this . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's all out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the guy, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And Armstrong tweet something about us and then, in December, Time magazine acknowledged us as one of the 50 best inventions, and it was really cool.
The best of all this -- and this is what ends up to close the circle is that in April of this year in the Mexican Gulf in the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called``Art in The streets . ''
And``Art in the streets"is going to have the best exponential art exponential, Exchanos Farma, CA, all of them are going to be there.
TMM is going to be in the, which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, make it possible.
None of the things that there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the School school was nothing possible at some moment.
Make it possible -- anything of this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with school recognition technology; I just acknowledged something and associated with wonderful people to be able to happen.
And these are the questions that I want us all to do every day when we find something that we feel that we have to do . If it's not now, when, and if I'm not, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years getting into usually very difficult situations and the same time a very dangerous.
I went to prison -- hard.
I worked in a coal mine, dangerous . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I filmed in war zones -- hard and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just this -- fun at first, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been immersed in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal to try and to test social issues in ways that are going to be attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyzed them in a way that you see entertainment and accessible for the audience.
So when I knew that I'd come here to make a TEDTalk about the world of brands and patriarch I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some may have heard it, or no, a couple of weeks ago, an airplane in eBay.
I sent some messages on Facebook, some of on Twitter, I was offered to sell the rights of my TEDTalk from 2011 . .
What was next:``Americans United North NOAVel present: My TEDTalk that you have no idea what it's about and content could exploit it in your face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company.
But I said this, it's a very good media opportunity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You know how many people look at these TEDTalks?
A lot.
It's a degree in progress, by the.
So even with that wonder I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have asked me a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to tell them.
But in the new film I'm working on, we tested the world of marketing, of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could anticipate me, for something as hard or as dangerous as I walk into the rooms with these guys . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan Space: : I, ,, I want to make a film that's about product collection, marketing and advertising, and that the whole film is funded with product collection, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call the``The largest movie ever ever ever . . . . . ''
What happens in``The biggest film ever ever ,"is that all of up on top, it's got brand images, all the time, from the authoritarian that appears before the title, the X brand.
Now this brand, Laurieland Stanford, the Center Center.
These people are going to be associated with the film to the philanthropy.
And so the film explores all of this idea .: . . .
I'm a relative weight . (: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It was``Petrient . ''
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X brand in the title, , we're going to make sure we're going to ensure all the categories we could on the film.
Maybe we're going to sell a shoe, and it becomes the biggest shoe you've used.
The most cool car you've been driving in``The largest film ever sold ,"the best wheat you have drunk, corresponding from``The biggest film ever sold . ''
David Kockhow: :, , then in addition to show the brands as part of life, make them funding the film? (. . . .
The whole film goal is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this film.
That's the full idea, all the film.
And I would love that blinded helps make it happen.
Robert Friedman: : You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it the maximum respect for the audience.
Well, ,, ,, , it's going to be people to that.
XL: : You have a perspective . I do -- I don't know if``angle"is very negative, but you know how it's going to?
MS: One million and a half . John Kamen: I think it's going to be hard to meet the meeting with them, but certainly it's going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands.
XL: : Who knows, maybe for the the moment the film is going to see us as a lot of joyful idiots.
MS: : What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart Freudian: Most answers will be``no . ''
MS: But will be hard to sell it, for the film or to being me? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
JK: Both.
MS :
So do they help me? I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: Good: Okay.
MK: We have to think about what brands . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
MS: Yeah . ,.
MK: : We have some places to go . (MS: Good .).
MS: I thought``the camera ,"meaning we have a conversation out of microphone.
It turns out the camera means,``We don't want to know anything about your film . ''
MS: , and it was, one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They wanted to know anything with this project.
And I was very impressed; I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to so many people see it as possible.
So especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the media separated, is not the idea to tell that new vehicle of attention that's going to to bring the message to the masses?
No, I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a guaranteed mistake and that mistake was this.
No, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But the problem was what this image represents.
See, when you look for images of transparency at Google, this is one of the first images that appear.
I like your radio way, Britain . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This was the problem: transparency -- free of simulation or deception -- easily detected or seen -- easily understandable, which is characterized by the visibility or an information of information, especially in business practices -- being the last line, perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard much about transparency in these days.
Our politicians name it, the president name, even CEOs name.
But all of a sudden when it comes to do it, something changes suddenly changes.
But why? Well, transparency gives fear -- like that weird bear that still continues.
It's unpredictable -- like this weird run.
It's also very risky.
What else is risky?
I'll be eating an entire bowl of Coke White.
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said,``No, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story, but you tell the history . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
See, when I was a kid, and my father caught me in a lie, and she, he's looking at me as I used to ask, and he said,``Son, there's three sides in every story.
It's your story, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As you see, in this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency would want to help me -- and that just because I met John Bond and Richard Kurihan in many years I realized that I would have to go on my mind, I, and go to companies myself with all my team . . .
So what I started to figure out -- -- what I started to realize is that when you start to conversation with companies, the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
MS: I have friends who make big, huge movies, and other people who make small movies, independent, like mine.
And my friends who make big Hollywood movies, big, giant, say that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the associated brands they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, ,``Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant Hollywood movies? ''
And the film is called the``The largest film ever sold . . . ''
How are we going to specifically see Ben in the film?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my bottle, you'll see the mess.
At any time during an interview with someone, ,, , you're okay for this interview?
Are you ready? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I want to help you calm.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the interview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And there you would offer one of these fabulous promises.
So much``Florida Florida"as``Pants of Paradise"will have its opportunity.
We're going to have so much for men as for women, solid, to pocket, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
That's the general view.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a promising view.
Karen Francis: : We're a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Similar to the kind of smaller movies that you'd have, ,, . . .
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So doing things like this, ,, ,, ,, ,.
MS: : What words use to describe Ben?
They were in white . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
KF: : That's a big question.
Woman: top.
MS: Technology is not the how you want to describe something that you put on the armpits.
Man: : We talk about something audacious, cool.
I think``cool"is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus,``combat the smell and sweat . ''
It keeps you fresh . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
How do you keep more time? With better fresh, more fresh, three times more fresh.
Things like those, the benefits.
MS: and that is a billionaire company.
What about me? What about a kind of kind?
I need to talk to the street man, the people like me, to the common Pepsi . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How you define your mark?
Man: My mark?
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: : reviewing the 1980s, penis, unless it's a laundry.
MS: Okay, what is the Jerry brand?
German: something . (MS :") Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have to be like a dark slight.
I like dark colors, many gray and things like this.
I usually have accessories like sunglasses, or I like crystal and similar.
Woman: : If Dan was a framework, it could be a, Merces Benz.
Man 2 : 2: the mark I am, would call it the casual flight.
Woman 2 : 2: In part hippie, in part of, in part of the Brooklyn, I don't know.
Man 3: : I am the kind of pets.
I see toys for pet toys in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In my little sector, that's my mark . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Man 4: : My brand is FedEx because I.
Man 5: March . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus . Marcus
Is that something?????? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
lawyer: I'm a lawyer.
Tom: I'm Tom . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
MS: Well, we can't all be brand Tom, but I often classified me in the dark interpretation and off.
I realized it needed an expert.
I needed someone who could enter my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the``branding personality . ''
And I found a company called Olson Zallad in Pittsburgh . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They helped companies like Netherlands, February, Harlem to discover that brand personality.
If they could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
Audience: : You brought the pictures, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
MS: . The first picture is a family picture.
A little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people model my seeing the world.
A :.
MS: That world? I, I think your world is the world where you live -- as people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things originated and start in a place, and in my case, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about?
MS: The next one is,``This was the the best day of my life . ''
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: : It's like who wanted to be me.
I like the different things.
I like the weird things . .
A:``Why ,"`` why"-- what does that serve us?
What is the male? ,?
Why is it important to reset? What does red represent?
Tell me a little about that.
A little bit more than you, that's not who you are . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What other metaphors have had?
You don't have to fear . What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: Hey!, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patient . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
MS: Yeah, , I don't know what's going to leave this.
There was lots of madness in this.
Michael Zalkzhodm: :, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , ,.
They're extremely good.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And I think some companies will only focus on one of their strong points or in the other rather than focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's the human nature to avoid the things that they're not safe; they avoid fear, those elements, and you actually give them to become something positive for you, and nice to see that.
What other brands are that?
The first here is the classic, Apple.
And you can see here to Target, Wii, Mini Counterflight and Keven.
Now there are playful brands and conscious brands, ,, , and it's a precise brand is something pretty powerful.
MS: a . . What's your brand?
If someone asks you to describe your brand identity, ,, ,, ,? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,? ,? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Are you a bottom-up attribute? . . .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?? .??????????????????????????????????
Or are you even a descending attribute?
A little bit more calm, reserves, conservative?
The surplus attributes are like being playful to be playful as the Prince, contemporary, adventure, dare or audacity like Eric Franklin, fast or glue, professional, , dominant or mystic or Gandhi.
Or are you good at descending?
Are you conscious, sophisticated like 1077?
Are you established, ,, ,, ,, ,? ,?? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?
Are you trustworthy, , stable, familiar, ,, ,, ,, , contemporary or wise, like the Dalai Lama or God?
And in the course of this film, we had more than 500 companies, surplus and offspring, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, wouldn't have control on the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of thought-controlled, and we came to tell the story in this film of how they now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing as for film.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising.
In all of the city over the last five years there are no valleys, there's no volcanoes, nothing.
And we went to school districts in which companies are doing way in schools in the United States.
The incredible thing to me is that the projects where I've had the the biggest answer, or that I've been more successful are those I've been interacting with things directly.
And that's what these brands do . .
They took out the intermediary, they took their agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies do don't have my best self-interest.
I'm going to deal directly with artist.
I'm going to work with it to create something different, something that's going to make people think, , who will challenge the way we look at . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
How did you have gone? Have they success?
Well, , from the movie of the in the University, let a look.
According to Budrus, the movie is sent in January, and since then, this is not all we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a a period of two and a half weeks.
That's just online -- no press, no TV . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The film wasn't distributed yet.
It's still not online ., . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It hasn't even been presented in other countries yet . . countries . .
Ultimately, this film has already started winning momentum.
And it's not not bad, because almost all the agencies that we're talking about would give up to their customers, not to be part of.
I've always believed that if you risk, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you pull people out of that, you're pushing them to failure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I think when you train their employees in aversion to risk, it's preparing all your business to be able to get a reward . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I feel what has to happen to move forward is we have to encourage people to risk.
We have to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities that they can scare them.
Ultimately, to move forward, I think we have to give rise to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
We open the fear . We open the risk.
From a spoon at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And in definition, we have to go to transparency.
Today than ever a little bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk talk talk, has been introduced by my good friends of ALS who for $7,000 bought the rights of the name in eBay.
EM: : converting big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
PJC presents,``Let's hug transparency . ''
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: : So, Morgan, on behalf of transparency, that exactly that $7,000?
MS: is an excellent question.
In my pocket, I have a child named from TED's marriage organization, the Sancifical Foundation, a a, to being applied to my adventure for the next year.
The idea behind the Stuxnet IT worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get a nuclear bomb.
The biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the University of the uranium of uranium in Natasha.
The gray boxes you see are systems of control in real time.
If we get commitment to these systems that control speed and valves, we can cause a lot of problems with centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't use Windows software; they're a completely different . technology . .
But if we managed to put a Windows cash virus in a wearable computer using an engineer to confuse this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind Stuxnet.
We started with a Windows installation.
The eye is income to the gray box, damage, and nuclear nuclear program is delay.
It's easy ,? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching Student six months ago, the was completely unknown.
All you knew is that it's very, very complex in the Windows part of Windows: the installed vulnerable vulnerability.
It seemed like doing something with these gray boxes, these control systems.
That called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with Stuxnet and saw what happened with this.
So they went very strange things.
Stuxnet was behaved as a a, who didn't like our, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experimenting with different cheese flavors, I realized, and I thought,``This is a direct attack . ''
It's completely directed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The installation is actively looking at the in the gray box, if you find a specific setup, and even if the program that is trying to infect is effectively working in that place . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If no, Stuxnet does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this nearly 24 hours a day, because I thought,``We, we don't know what the goal is . ''
It could be, say for example, a U.S. energy plant, or a in Germany . .
Better than we discovered the goal soon.
So we extracted and we picked up the attack code, and we discovered that I was structured in two digital bombs: a little and a big.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed by people who obviously had all the internal information . .
They know all of the points that I'll attack.
You probably know how much the operator is.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the Student installation is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the is very complex.
It's very above all we've seen before.
So here's a sample of this attack code.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much the old language.
I want to tell you how we could find this code.
What we were looking at at first were called the systems of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking for temperatures and data structures and we tried to relate to the real world, with objective potential objects.
We need theories about dinosaurs that we could approve or challenge.
To get to theories about goals, we remember it's definitely a violent savanna, it must be a valuable white, ,, , and on Iran, because it's where most infections has been reported . . .
There are several thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils to the nuclear energy plant of Bush and to the National enriched plant . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So I said to my assistant,``Give me a list of all experts in centrifuge and energy plants between our clients . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I called them them, and I took them into an effort to connect their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So we could associate the little digital landscape with the control of the rock.
The rotor is that cell part of within the, that black object you see.
If you manage the speed of this rotor, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,.
What we also saw is that the attack goal was to make it slow and discover in an obvious effort to get crazy to the maintenance engineers, so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to decipher the big digital landscape observing very close to data and their structures.
So for example, the number 1964, it's going to be in that code, you can't be obvious.
I started researching scientific literature about how these centrifuge are built in Natasha and found that they are structured in what is called a, , , 164 centrifuge . . . . . . . . .
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better.
These centers in Iran are divided in 15 parts called stages . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And guess what we found in the attack code?
A nearly identical structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had between hands.
So there's no misunderstanding: it didn't.
The results have been obtained after several weeks of hard work.
We were normally in computers without exit and we had to start to start.
Yet, we found that both digital opinions were pointing on one and same goal, but from different angles.
The small lady is taking a, and doing spinning the rocks and relative them, and the big tide is communicating with six waterfalls and manipulating valves.
In sum, we're very confident that we've determined what the destination is.
It's Natasha, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We should not worry about other goals to be hit by Stuxnet.
I'm showing you some very interesting things that we saw, really impressed me.
There's the gray box, and above you see the centrifuge.
What this thing does is it intercept the input values of sensors for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors and provide legitimate code, which is still executed during the attack, with false input data.
And believe or no, these false input data are predicted by Stuxnet . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the robbery, the security camera is feeding video.
Is it great?
The idea here is obviously not just going to hang the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and aggressive . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The idea is to build a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast . . .
For example, in an energy plant, ,, , when the great steam turbine comes from speed, you have to open escape valves in a milliseconds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Obviously, this can't make a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems . .
And when you're engaged, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The plant can explode.
And or the operating system, you'll notice it.
That scares.
But it can be.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this . This attack is generic.
It has nothing to do, specifically, with centrifuge, with uranium delivery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It could work also, for example, in an energy plant, or an automotive factory.
It's generic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And you don't have.
You could also use a conventional technology of worms to designing them . . . . . . .
Discovering it as much as possible.
And if you do that, , what you end up is with a marine destruction cyber.
That's the the consequence we should face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We have to face the consequences, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: : I have a question.
Ralph, it has been public in many sides that people assume that the Museum is the the main entity behind this . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What is your opinion?
Ralph Langley: : Okay, . .
Yeah . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
My view is that the Museum is involved, ,.
The engine behind this is cyber superpower.
There's one, and that's the the the, fortunately, fortunately.
Because otherwise, our problems would be even bigger.
CA: Thank you for terrified . Thank you, Ralph.
I want you to imagine a robot that can be taken and that it gives you some sustainable skills, or another one that makes users out of wheelchair up up and go back and walk.
In``Berkeley Bionics ,"we call these robots, exoskeletons . . . . . . . . . . .
It's nothing different about something that's put in the morning, it gives you a great force, which also increases your speed, and helps, for example, to manipulating balance.
It's actually the true integration of the man and the machine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect it with the universe and with other outside.
This is not an irrational idea . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So to show you now in what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier that, on average, has to take over a 45 pounds charge, and it's getting to bring even more equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Now obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries in the back , 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage damage.
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create an exoskeleton that could help to manage the issue.
Let me introduce you to the H5N1 -- or Party Campaign.
Soldier: : With the H5N1 exoskeleton I, I can cover 90 pounds per variables for many hours.
Its flexible design, ,, , it allows you to to go back and run motion with great agility . .
I perceive what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then I increase my strength and my resistance.
expert Benjamin: We're ready, with our industrial partner, to producing this device, this new exoskeleton, this year.
I mean, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We're going to go back now to the users of wheelchair, about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in wheels, around the world.
Like one percent of the population.
And this is really conservative calculation.
We talk about something that happens often, very young people, with damage in the vertical column that you start their life -- at 20 , 30 or 40 -- they collide a wall and wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that aging that is rapidly multiplied.
Its only option, ,, a lot of times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been like for the last 500 years, from his success emergence, I I . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the EEG that is using Amanda Boxops, who's 19 years ago had a lesion in the backbone, and as a result couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda Boxait: Thank you.
EB: : Amanda is using our ALS, I mentioned.
It has a few sensors.
I completely don't invasive in the in the crutches that send signals to the onboard, ,.
There are also a couple of batteries that give you energy to engines, and in the knees, and you make it going on with this soft and very natural gait . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
AB: I was 24 years on the top of my life when, for a stranger jump in the air, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In a fraction of a second, I lost all sensation and everything from the pelvis down.
A little time later, , a doctor entered my room in the hospital, and he said,``Amanda, you'll never walk back . ''
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole the last piece of hope of my self.
The adaptation technology since then, , has allowed me to to learn to deploy it down in ski, climbing rocks and even riding in hand bike . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But haven't invented anything that allows me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, , and we've got all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just of soldiers, but Amanda, and all the wheelchair users, all of them.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the baton, they practice sex to say hi, ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And no, it's not not the American Man, or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know their cousins . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is the world of the wild bonobos of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, , their closest lives.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimps are known for their aggression . . . .
But unfortunately, we've done too much in this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But bonobos show the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big guys, frightening, ,, , Bonobo society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special, , because this leads to a a very tolerant society where lethal violence hasn't yet noticed.
But unfortunately, bonobos are the least understood of great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest, and it has been very hard to study them.
The Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the itself itself -- stage of a violent conflict that has been released for decades and causes almost as many deaths as World War II.
It's not surprising that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
The heart of hunting meat and deforestation make you can't fill or a stadium with the bonobos that you are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure that.
However, in this violence of violence and chaos, you can hear the hidden laughter by hitting trees.
Who are these cousins?
We know them as apes, not war, not war, because they have frequent, promiscuous and bisexual sex to confinement conflict and solving social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of humanity's problems because the Bonobo's life is more than the Kamen Survey . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The bonobos, like humans, are love to play all their life.
Jugaad is not just a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For us, and for them, play is fundamental to establish ties and encourage tolerance.
We learn to trust, and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo game, you see the evolutionary roots itself of laughter, dance and human rituals . .
The game is the glue that unites us.
I do I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique video videos taken from the wild.
First of all, it's a Bonobo lifestyle game;, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Here's a female and a young male male in the middle of a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Look what she is doing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It could be the the evolutionary origin of the phrase:``It's got it out of the balls . ''
I just think that in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is common to both boats like humans.
And this video really is interesting because it shows -- this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play -- the testicles, and also how play requires trust and promotes trust -- and at the same time, it's the most fun . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But play is problematic.
The game is a police, it can take a lot of shapes, some of which are more quiet, imaginative, curious -- maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to see -- this is Facebook, a young female, who is playing with water.
I think, like she, sometimes we play alone, and explore the limits of our inner and outer worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact, , and then the unexpected connections that we form are the real seed of creativity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
These are just little samples of understanding that Bonobo gave us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our our future, , a that we have to adapt to a more time increasingly difficult and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capacities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In other words, the game is our adaptation.
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But do we leverage our game capacity?
The game is not frivolous.
The game is essential . . . . . . . .
For Bonobo and human, life is not just cruel and ruthless.
When it looks like the least appropriate play, , ,'s most urgent.
That's why, primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as we're dealing with creativity, friendship and awe.
Thank you.
In New York, I am responsible to develop a non-profit organization called Robin Hood.
When I'm not changing poverty, combat fires as a captain in a copy of volunteer firemen.
And in our city, where volunteers are contemplating a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire in the fire very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But still there was a racing racing against the other volunteers to get to the captain, and figure out what our task was.
When I found the captain, I was confronted in a conversation with the owner that certainly would take one of the worst days of his life.
We were at night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a umbrella, in pajamas, barefoot, as her house was in flames.
The other volunteer I had just arrived before I was, let me call it Alex Luther came first to the captain, and he asked him to walk and save the dog's dog.
The dog . I .!! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .! .!.
There was a lawyer or a concrete of money that, during the rest of her life, would have to tell people who entered a building in flames to save a living self just because it five seconds.
Well, next.
The captain took me a lot.
He said, , I need that in the house.
I need to go up, go through the fire, ,, and bring this woman a couple of shoes . ''
I swear.
It wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but I went -- I went up the stairs, at at the end of the, I went up with the general firemen, and that height sort of just turned out the fire and entered the main room in search for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my charge back through the ladder where I Mission and the, in the main door.
We're going to get out of the house, the treasures for the home owner where, as it was waiting, their treasure received much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house of home by the brave effort demonstrated to save your house.
The kindness that she looked at about what she was looking about was that someone had come up even a couple of shoes.
And so much in my vocation in Robin Hood as my vocation as a volunteer fireman, I'm a witness of generosity and kindness in a monumental scale, but also from acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or they are, you know, I'd like to remind you: they don't expect.
They don't wait for the first million to make the difference in someone's life.
If you have something to give you now.
They serve food in a, ,, . . . . . . . . . .
Be mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, ,, ,, , to someone's life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So they enter play; they come out the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark Bezos: Thank you.
This may seem strange, , but I'm a of concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were made in 1968 with a very simple idea: cement modules of a a fixed measure that fits each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build larger things than us, ,, , like buildings, a a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And essentially these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the LIGO came to Lego.
It's called Automatic assembly brick.
And in a few years, LEDs bricks came to all the homes.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
Legitzen did it accessible . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
LEDs simply adopted the concrete block, the favorite in the world, and became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in Bell labs, the next revolution was about to announce: the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of static bricks, which would take one of one another to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block, the transistor allows to create much larger and more complex circuits, a a . .
But there's a main difference: : The transistor was just for experts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I personally don't accept it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, , I decided to change.
Eight years ago, when I was at in the Media Lab, ,, ,, ,, ,, I started exploring the idea to the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing.
I'm going to show you how it works.
Lithia are electronic modules each with specific function.
They're ready to being light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing is that they come together through magnets.
So you can't put it wrong . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The bricks have a color code . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The green is the output, the blue blue is the the, the pink is the input and the orange of orange is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue blue with a green, and very quickly you can start doing bigger circuitry.
A green with one green.
We can put a button in the middle, and so we have a regulators.
If we change the button for a pulse module, which is here, ,, . .
We add this doorbell to create more impacts and we have a noise machine.
I'll stop this.
So beyond the simple game, letters are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and solar, literary allows us to program by using very simple intuitive gestures.
To make you blink or slower, you just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind elites is it's a growing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to be reduced to bricks to use.
Light, sounds, , solar panels ,; it must be accessible.
We've given kids to kids to see them play with them.
It's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For instance, how a light at night, or why the a door of an elevator keeps open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to the design schools.
So for example, designers without any experience in electronics start playing with elites like a . . .
Here you can see, with paper bottle and filter, we have George creating ...
( Clicks sound) -- a few weeks ago we led to the designers of the Rhode Island design School design, who have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said,``Do something . ''
Here's an example of a project that they've done, a activated by motion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But wait, here comes my favorite project.
It's a block that's made of darkness that has fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, , letters became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be aware of everyone.
So, letters have open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and manufacture them.
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world, is ours.
So forward and invent.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the the in the solar technology industry.
And my little company seeks to engage with the environment.
The distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
Mmm . Wait for a moment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You can delay a little bit in charge.
We can -- we can continue the video better.
No . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is not.
Okay.
Solar technology is ...
Ah, time?
Okay . Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that they are supposed to do, and we asked them to work in government.
The initiative is called Code For America, and it would be like a percent of Peace Peace.
We select some members every year and put them to work with the municipalities.
Instead of sending them to the Third World, we send them to the wild world.
They did great applications; . . . .
Your task is to showing the possibility of current technology.
You'll know Allah.
It's a city in Boston City.
So here it appears like to look for a quote, but what I really find is that someone cleans it when it's caught by the snow because you know that it's not very good at turning fire up when it is covered by a subway meter.
How did he ask aid in this so singular?
Last year in Boston, we had a team of Complicated Companies.
They were there in February, and at that moment, it was a lot last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned these hydrants.
But one of the members called Erik Michael noticed something else: , that citizens cleaned up the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did any good programmers, he developed an app . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's a nice application where you can adapt an hydrogen.
You accept to clean it when you go.
When you do it, you put a name in this case, in this case.
If you don't do it, someone can steal.
I mean, it has a playful component.
It's a modest app . .
Maybe it's the smaller of the 21 applications that last year.
But it does something that no other technology in the government does.
And it spreads viral form.
A responsible of the City City systems in the looking at this application realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to support tsunami signals . . .
It's very important that these tsunami signals work, but people steal the batteries.
So he calls the citizens that control them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens bring out the damaged disasters . . . . . . . .
And Chicago just launched it to get people to record to clean sidewalks when the snow.
So now we know nine cities that they plan to use.
And this has been spread without friction, organically and natural.
If you know a little government technology will know that this doesn't normally happen.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that required three people for two and a half months.
It was a that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that we've done it by normal channels would have taken at least two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the judicial power of California that, in fact, has cost 2,000 million dollars and doesn't work.
And there's projects like this on every level of government.
So an app that is programmed in a, and spread in viral form, is a a, in the government institution.
It suggests the better government to work, not as in private companies, like a should be . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Nor as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without restrictions, in an open way.
And that is important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents how to address the question of government that has the new generation -- not a problem of an analog institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it it turns out that we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools so we work together with efficacy.
And it's not just Code for America, but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute with civic apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given with government.
They feel a great frustration for that but they don't complain, they fix it.
And these people know something that we've lost lost.
And that is that if we leave the, the feelings about politics, the row on the DMV, and all of those other things that we have crazy, the government is essentially in Tim Anderson's words:``What we do together because we only can't . ''
Now, many people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask you to you to think about it, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Politics doesn't change; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And given that the government ultimately shows from us -- remember that,``We, the people ,"and thinking about how to produce change.
I didn't know a lot about government when I started this.
And as a lot of people think that government is to choose people to choose to occupy charges.
Well, after two years, I've come to the conclusion that government is, especially, a matter of garage.
This is the the phone care of services and information.
It's the the place that calls the calls if you mark 31 in the U.S.
Scott does this call.
They entered the``Zarbia"in the official knowledge base.
I found nothing . It started with animal control.
And finally he said,``Hey, can you open the door doors, put music good and see if you go? ''
And it works . So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the the.
Boston has no call center.
It has an application, web and mobile called City Connecticut.
We don't program that app . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It was the work of very smart people in the New Mechanical University of Boston.
One day, this happened really, comes up with this request: ,, I don't know if it's dead.
How do I take it out? ''
The dynamics of Citizen Connecticut is different . . .
Scott was talking in person . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In Citizen Connecticut, it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, I saw a neighbor.
The next report said,``I came to the place, found the trash cube behind the house.
Zero? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I went around the cube . I went home.
Good night, sweet . ''
Pretty simple.
So this is great . It is the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it also is a great example of the income of government to distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platform . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And here I don't necessarily mean the technological definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to self-assemble and help others.
So, a citizen helped another, but here the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And you could have connected them to the government services of being necessary, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When a neighbor helps another, we strengthen communities.
If we call animals, that costs a lot money.
One important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same as politics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A lot of people who understand it, but it thinks that one is the entrance of the another . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
That our in the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader? ,? ,??? ,?, ., and then we don't see changes.
That's because government is like an immense ocean and politics is the 15,000 inches.
Underneath is what we call bureaucracy.
And we say that word with much contempt.
But it's that waste that keeps us that that we finance as something that operates on our, that other thing, and in the, we are losing power.
People think politics is sensual.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make bureaucracy sensitive.
Because it's where the real government work occurs.
We have to collaborate with government machinery.
That makes the Copenhagen movement . .
Have you seen them??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
It's a group of worried citizens that have written a very detailed report from 125 pages in response to the``Steven Commission"on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism, , it's bureaucratic activism . .
And for those of us who have gone to the government, is time that we ask ourselves what world we want to leave our children.
You've got to see the enormous challenges that you will have to face.
Do you really think we'll get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of all?
We can't predict government, we need it to being more effective.
The good news news is that with technology, it is possible to rethink of root function so that it can spread to civil society.
There's a generation that I grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act with a lot, and there's only to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I, to regeneratives, I am a generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up with the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who to talk; they're all going to talk.
You can express your opinions at at the same time and do it.
So when they face the government problem doesn't care much to make their voices.
They are using hands . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They put hands to the work to program applications that make the government work better.
And those applications allow us to use hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaned by a hydrogen, ,, ,, ,, ,, , that has a garage inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned those and many people do it.
But these applications are kind of digital reminder that we're not only consumers, we're not just government consumers we pay taxes and we get services.
We're more than that: , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And we're not going to fix government until we don't fix citizenship.
So I want to ask ask all of the, when is it about the important things we have to do together, all together, will be a crowd crowd, or will we be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in jails, prisons and in death row . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I've spent most of my life in marine communities, in projects and places where there's a lot despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimuli, has given me a lot.
So one of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
Sometimes, if something comes from TED, it a sense and a force that would not have otherwise.
I mean, because I think identity is truly important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach feeling, you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, whether it's charitable, it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the right, my work . . . . .
I learned about my grandmother.
I grew up in a a traditional family family, dominated by a matriarch, , . .
It was hard, it strong, I had power.
It was the last word in the family.
She spent a lot of the arguments in our home.
It was people who had been slaves.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia about 1840.
She was born about the 1880s and his experience with slavery as he sees the world.
She was hard, but it was also loving.
When I was a little kid, and I looked at it, she came to me and I was a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe, and then I was dumped.
One or two hours later, he came back to look at it, came to me and said,``Hey, do you still feel my hug? ''
And if I said no, I would grab again and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the least 10.
At times, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capturing his time and attention . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room, and they were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was the other side of the room and looked at me.
At first I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it and smiled, but she was very serious.
After 15 minutes, she got up, and went back the room, took me out of my hand and said,``You see Brian . We are going to talk . ''
I remember this like yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said,``Brian, you'll tell you something, but you can't tell anybody . ''
I said,``Well, Mom . ''
She said,``Now I make sure you don't ."I said,``Sure . ''
And then I sat down, and he looked at me, and he said,``I want you to know I've been watching you . ''
And he added,``I think you're special . ''
He said, you can do whatever you want . ''
I'll never forget it.
Then he said,``I just want you to promise three things, Brooklyn . ''
I said,``Sure, Mom . ''
And he said,``The first thing I want you to promise is you always want your mother . ''
He said, ,``She's my daughter, and you have to promise me to always take care . ''
As I loved my mom, I, I, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And then he said,``The second thing I want you to promise me is you always do the right thing even though the right thing is hard . ''
I thought, and I said,``Yeah, Mom . I do . ''
And then finally he said,``The third thing I want you to promise me is you never do alcohol . ''
I was nine years old, and I said,``Yeah, Mom, I will . ''
I grew up in the field, in rural . I have a younger year and a sister a less year.
When I was 14, one day my brother came home with a little bit of six beers, I didn't know where he took them, , and me, and we went to the forest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We're just doing the madness.
He took a beer board, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me.
I said,``No, no, no . It's okay . You follow, but I . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
My brother said,``Come . Today we do . And you always do the same thing as us.
I took something, your sister also . Take a beer beer beer . ''
I said,``No . I wouldn't feel good . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said,``What happens? Take a beer beer . ''
I take my gaze with strength and continue,``Oh, not you're still thinking about the conversation with Mom . ''
I said,``But what are you talking about? ''
He said, to all the grandchildren who are special.
I was left.
I have to admit something about you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread widely.
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't thinking it's a virtue; I mean it for the power that identity has.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really don't see it.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been pressure for ban ban . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
My uncles died from age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we should engage.
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In 1972, there were 300,000 prisoners . .
Today there are 2.3 million.
We have the the largest incarceration rate in America.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration, in my opinion has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor or black communities, it's so so much despair, so despair, determined by these facts.
One in three black between the age of 18 and 30 is in prison or in parole.
In urban communities from all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington , 50 to 60 percent of all the young people are in prison or in parole freedom.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a judicial system that is much better if you're rich and guilty, that if you are poor and innocent.
It's not guilt, it's wealth.
And it seems to be very quiet.
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not problems.
We're disconnected.
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work in our work some very curious development.
In my state, in Alabama, as well in other states, you're spreading rights for always if you have a criminal sentence.
Right now in Alabama , 34 percent of the black male population has lost definitely the right to vote.
And if we project it over the next 10 years, the level of law loss will be as elevated to how before the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where kids from 13 to die in prison.
We have in this prison prison for children, no possibility to coming out ever . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Right now we are in a few litigation.
The only country in the world.
It represents people on death row.
This thing of death penalty is interesting.
So, in a sense, have you taught us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for the crime's crime?
Very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way to look at it: : it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by the crimes committed, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by error . . .
For every nine people executed, it has identified one that is innocent and released from the edge of death.
A rate of error, astonishing, an innocent in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation, it would never be allowed to pilot airplanes if from every nine to go down, you would have been quiet.
But somehow we're isolating the problem.
It's not our our.
It's not our burden . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's not our.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about African history, talk about slavery.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time that it started at the end of the reconstruction, and it lasted to World War II.
Really, we don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror terror.
In many communities, people were afraid to be launched.
I worry to be bombarded.
The threat of the terror was what their lives defined . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Now there are older people who get closer to me, and they say,``Mr. Steven, you're telling talks, making speeches . ., , for the first time with terrorism, after 9/11 . ''
They ask me to say, ,.
The age of terrorism continued, obviously, with vegetation and decades of racial and separation grant.
In this country, we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our history.
And that's why we haven't understood what we historically have done.
And all the time we're happy with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It costs us to talk about race, , and I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood you couldn't overcome racial vegetation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done.
I was in Germany giving conferences on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said,``You know it's okay to hear what you say . ''
He said,``We don't have death row in Germany.
We will never be able to have it here . ''
The room was quiet and a lady said,``There's no way that with our history, we could ever get to the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, intense and deliberately, we would put people together . ''
Think about this.
How would we feel in a a, ,, especially if they were in their most Jews????????????????????????????????????????????????????
We could not tolerate.
It would be irrational.
And yet there is this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really worry about these hard issues, the positive and wonderful things are, however, implicated.
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are excited about suffering, ,, ,, marketing.
In my opinion, you need to integrate both things.
We've lately talked about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more dedication with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the devices, the ones that will never get to TED . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Think about them is, in a way, something that is inside our.
It's true that we have to believe in issues we haven't seen.
So we, despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual.
With innovation, with creativity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
These things come from food ideas also through heart convictions.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and broadcasting, but also in the dark and hard.
Vacainium Hava, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He said,``When we were in Eastern Europe suffering, we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in despair sites and being witnesses . ''
Well, that orientation for spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, has to engage.
There is no disconnect that's related to technology and design, that allows us to being truly human if we don't paying attention to poverty, to exclusion, to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
Let's find them.
I had the great privilege, , being a very young lawyer, to know Rosa Parks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
These women are simply gathered to talk.
Occasionally, the Caraca lady calls me, to tell me,``Brian, comes the Ladden lady . We're going to gather to talk.
Do you want to come and hear? ''
I said,``Yes ma'am . I want . ''
So she said,``Well, what do you do when you come? ''
I said,``Listen . ''
So I was going and I just heard them.
It was something very vibrant, very lighting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And in one occasion there, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , the was a couple of hours, the Mrs. Park was headed to me and said,``Now, Brian, tell me that it's the equal justice.
Tell what you're trying to do . ''
And I started giving it my speech.
I said,``Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted unfairly.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without parole for children.
We try to do something about the death penalty.
We try to reduce population in jails.
We try to end up with massive incarceration . ''
I gave it all my best speech, and at the end, he looked at me, and he said,``Miss um um! . . . . . . . . ''
And added,``I'm going to get exhausted, very exhausted . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At that time, ., , ., . and said,``That's why you have to be very, very brave . ''
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more valuable.
We have to figure out how to face those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I've come to understand and believe that each one of us is top to the worst we have committed.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a, ,, it it's not a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong, it not a thief.
Even if someone kills another, it not a killer.
So I think there's a basic dignity in people who must be respect by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts of the opposite to poverty is justice.
And finally, I, even though it's very dramatic, very beautiful, very light, very stimulating, we won't judge us for our technology, ,, ,, or rational or rational capacity.
And at the end, you judge the character of a society, not the how you treat rich, powerful and privileged, but in the way you treat the poor, the condemned, the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Sometimes I feel balanced . I to a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
I get tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my regrets in an important way . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I've been representing these guys who have been sentenced with a lot of toughness.
I go to prison and I see my 13 and 14, which have been inhabited to be judged as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone in what is not?
The judge did it as adults, but I see a child.
One night, I was awake thinking -- by God, if judge can turn you into something you are not, must have magical powers.
Yeah, Brian, , has magic power.
You should ask some of that.
Now, as it was too late, I couldn't think properly, but I started working on a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He had a, a, ,, black.
I started working on the, with an embodiment that said, ,,``Money for my 14 year-old black client is treated as a 25-year-old private white corporate . ''
In the, I put it in the moment that there had been behavioral behavior in accusation, in police behavior and in the process.
There was an aircraft line on how this country is not ethical, but a lack of ethics.
And the next morning, I woke up thinking that inherent motion would be a dream, or did I really write?
For my horror, not only did it read it, but he had sent it to court.
They spent about two months, I.
And finally I decided --``Oh God, I have to go to the court for this stupid case . ''
I got up to the, and I was really overwhelmed, overwhelmed . ., . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I went into the court.
I thought this would be very hard and generous.
I finally went down the car . I walked the judge . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I was coming up with the stairs when I met a bigger black man; it was the joke.
When he saw me, he came to me and he said,``Who is you? ''
I said,``I'm a lawyer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So I get closer to me and embracing me.
And I'm sleeping in the ear.
He said,``I'm proud of you . ''
I have to tell you now that that was surveillance.
That was deeply connected with my inside, ,, with my identity with the ability we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I entered the audience room.
I got into the judge.
And he said,``Mr. Steven, you wrote this wave? ''
I said,``Yes Mr. I was me ,"and we started discussing.
People started coming . They were all indigenous.
I was the one who had written those madness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They came up with the cops, the applied prosecutors, the abuse.
And suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people . They were all furious, because we talked about race, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the peacock of my eye, , I was forced to see the I was and came.
I was looking through the window and claimed to hear all that scream.
I kept walking for here and there.
Finally, this old black, with a concern face, entered the room and sat behind me, almost on the lawyers table.
About 10 minutes later, the judge did a prescription.
During the course, an assistant of the algae was shown upset because the counselor had entered the room.
The assistant was released on old black.
He said,``Jimmy, what do you do in the audience room? ''
And the old black man stood, he looked at the assistant, and he looked at me and said,``I went into this room of audience to tell this young man who would keep her view in the objective target . ''
I've come to TED today because I think a lot of you understand that moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds into justice.
We can't be truly human evolved if we don't worry about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is tied to others.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be released to brotherhood, compassion and justice.
And above all of, those of the present that you share this, I just want to tell you that you keep the view in the objective goal.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: You just heard and see an obvious desire of the audience, , to help in your purposes, to do something.
Something that is not a check . . . . . . . . . . . . . .? . .? . .? . .? . .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?? .?? .?? .?? .?? .?? .??
BL: there are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a referendum this spring in which you're going to make an effort to reducing the funds that you spend today in punishment policy . policy . policy . policy . policy . policy . policy . policy . policy . policy . policy . policy . policy . policy . policy . policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on the death row, in the next five years . .
And despite this , 46 percent of , 46 percent of humans don't conclude in arrest.
56 percent of people don't get to anything.
Here's an opportunity for change . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So this reference is going to propose that these funds are going to get into the law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in crime in the United States in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, , it's said that it has to do with the largest incarceration rate.
What would you say to those people who think it is that?
Bess: , actually, the violence rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass incarceration in this country is not crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the circular population.
And we let us convince the record of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into perpetual chain, to steal a bicycle, for small crimes against property, rather than making those resources to their victims . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I think we have to do more to help the victims of criminals and not not less . . .
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: Brand, , we've been excited about working today.
You're very inspiring . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Oh, my God!
Peter Diamandis: :: These are just some of the the clips that I got in the last six months, and they could basically be over the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that press media prefer to provide negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that answers a very good reason.
In every second day, our senses get much more data than probably the brain can process.
And like nothing else matters to survive, the first couple of all that data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called amygdala . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the danger detector.
It creates and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us hurt.
So of a dozen stories, we'll prefer to look at the negatives.
That old one of the thought,``If there's blood, sell ,"is very true.
And since all digital devices will provide negative news at seven days in the week , 24 hours a day, no wonder we're pessimistic.
It's not surprising that people think that the world goes from bad in worse.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe, instead, what's really happening is that we received distractions.
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century for a accelerating in such a way that we have the potential to create an abundance world in the next three decades.
I'm not saying we don't have our good problems: climate change, species extinction, water shortage and energy; we certainly have them.
As human beings, we're really good to avoid the problems and, in the long, we've gone with them.
We analyzed it in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, , the average life is more than doubled, average per capita per capita per, has tripled around the world.
Child mortality has been reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of electricity, transportation and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles Kennedy spent 25 percent over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
Many people forget it.
And we continue to put higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty . . .
Think about it today in the United States, a lot of people who live under the line of poverty have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators, television, mobile air, conditioning air and cars.
The markets of of the last century of the past century, the planets on the planet, would never have dreamed of such luxury.
By supporting a lot of this is technology, and lately their exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that goes on in technology technology jump out in this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling price performance in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the cell phone that you have in the pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a 70-dollar supercomputer.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to see two things in this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time, in the war and in peace, in recession, in depression and at.
It's a result of rapid computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before the big challenges.
And although it's graffiti in a law on the left, it's curved up.
The growth rate of technology is it gets faster and faster.
And in this curve, in Moore's Law bombings, there's a really powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computation in the cloud, that my Autodesk friends call infinite computing, , sensors and networks, robotics , 3D, and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, ,, ,, vaccines and food, digital medicine, national and the and A.I.
I mean, how many saw the victory in Jefforting, from IBM?
It was epic.
I looked for the in the newspapers the best headline.
And I loved this:``Watson sells human opponent . ''
Jeopardy is not a game.
It plays with the nuances of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone in the mobile.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and me, , we launched a new university called Singapore University . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So we teach them these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they use to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to launch a company, , or a product or service, that can possibly affect a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have sound absurd.
Today we can make a dozen companies that have been done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create fancy life for every single planet on the planet; it's about creating a possible . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's about taking that that is scarce and turning it plentiful.
You see, the scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon Three in 1800.
He's the kind of the left.
I invited to dinner the king of Simon.
Napoleon troops ate with silver covers, and the same Napoleon, with gold covered.
But Simon king, ate with aluminum covered.
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet; it's more than gold and platinum.
And so the tip of the Monterey to Washington is aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is 83 percent of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal.
It's bound by oxygen and solids.
But then the electronics came up and made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it definitely.
We projected this analogy to the future . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a ball planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 minutes of energy every 88 minutes . . . . .
It's not a shortage, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And there's good news news news news.
This year, for the the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the diesel of diesel: eight rupees versus 17 rupees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The solar energy cost fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents the kilowatts per hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have energy abundance, we also have water abundance.
Let's talk about wars now.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager Space spacecraft to Earth in 1990, ,??? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .??????????????????????????????
I got a . .? . .? . .? . .? . .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?
\" A pale blue blue . ''
Because we live in a water planet.
We live on a covered planet in 70 percent per water . . .
Yeah , 97 percent is water water, two percent is ice, and we fought about 0.5 percent of the planet's water, but there's a hope hope.
It's a technology available not 10 20 years, but right now.
National nanotechnology comes from, projections.
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the in the school -- I'd like to share with you, he gave me permission to do it -- his technology called Slippiness, which is the size of a small refrigerator.
It's capable of to generate a thousand gallons of clean water in any day of water, computer water, a latrine for less than two cents the liter.
The president of Coca-Cola just agreed that to a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola will implement it globally in 2006 countries on the planet.
This is an innovative innovation by this technology today.
And we've seen it in cellphones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent of the cell phones in the developing world in the late 2013.
Think about it, that dough warrior has better mobile communications in Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to talk with an intelligent cell phone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of information and communications that nobody could have predicted ever.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and I and I've paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- GPS, video, images, book library libraries and music, medical diagnostic technology will now melt and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing is when they add health applications.
Last month, I to announce with the Manhattan Foundation something called the Developed Caulter Prize , 10 million dollars.
We're challenging the teams of the world to combine these technologies in a mobile device that they talk about, and since it's an A.I ., ,, . . .
To win has to make better diagnostics than a certified medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors, where mobility charge is 25 percent, and there's 1.3 percent health workers.
When this device sequences a DNA virus or DNA, which I don't recognize, to call health and, first, avoid the pandemic.
But this is the the biggest force to produce an abundance world.
I call it the the billion in increase.
The white lines here are the population.
We just spent the March 7.
By the the way, the best protection against democracy explosion is to the to the to education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, to spend two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never heard about global conversation.
What do these people want?
What do you consume? . .
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars injected in global economy.
And they'll get more health thanks to the Titanic, of a, of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D printing and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What can you give us three billion more than human, educated healthy healthy healthy healthy health?
How about a few voices ever before?
What if we give the oppressed, wherever you are, a a voice to be heard and power to act for the first time?
What are these three billion?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
What if they are contributions that we can't predict????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
So something that I learned with the X Prize is that small teams, guided by their passion with a clear goal, can do extraordinary things -- things that before only could do the great corporations and governments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I'm going to finish sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called Foldit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He emerged at in Washington University, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine structure and functionality.
It's something very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of supercomputers.
They've played with this university teachers, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started to play it.
And it has been shown that the recognition machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to assume the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovation.
We have the capitalist capital.
And we have three billion new minds that would join us to work in the solution of large challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea.
The point of stop.
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in 1835 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You might believe it's chasing pizza, but it didn't.
I actually collect fish.
And I described one of them as a``common . ''
It was the.
It's a lot of it until the 1880s.
Now the fish is at at the Red Rouge at IUCN.
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is we still come to Galapagos.
We still think they're practical.
The brochures still say they're still intact.
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: the displacement of the waist.
Because I was there in 1971 studying a lagoon in West Africa . .
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could integrate.
I burned a lot with the sun and was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exposure to sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by palms, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There were about 20 centimeters, the black bar tilapia.
And the fishing of this tilapia was very abundant and spent for a good moment, , in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had halved half.
They killed the five centimeters.
They experience a . . . .
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was an introduction in the introduction fishing fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the in the 1970s, he started in 1960, did a lot of development projects.
The weight development used to impose countries that already had 100,000 fishermen, to impose the industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite ugly, was called The Mutation 4 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I went out to fishing on him, and we did studies in the South Sea Sea, and on the Middle Sea Sea Sea Sea Sea Sea.
What we captured there was something incredible.
We captured, now I know, the sea bottom.
Ninety percent of what we captured were sponges, other animals that are in the.
And most of the fish are tiny blobs about a few remains, the remains that are coral reef fish . . . . . . . . .
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck, and then it was thrown.
These images are extraordinary because transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study, and then commercial fishing starts.
The bottom goes from being a solid coral background, in this case, to be a paleontologist.
This is a dead turtle.
They didn't eat them . They were thrown out because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I wasn't even drowned.
So they wanted to kill it because it was a good food.
This mountain of rest is what you collect the fishermen every time you go in an area where you have never fish . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But there's no documented.
We transform the world, but we don't remember it.
We adjust the point of departure, the new level, without remembering what was there.
If we generalize that happens, something like that.
On the, on the axis, we have good things: biodiversity, amount of oral, the the the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time ., because people do things with nature.
Each generation will use the images of their conscious life as normal and straightforward forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the change of change . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And at the end, I'll keep a few remains.
And that, in large, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer, or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when predatory societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that is very abundant, before we get extinct, is slightly frequent.
You don't lose abundant animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this isn't perceived as a great loss . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Over time, we focus on large animals, and in a synthetic sea of great fish.
They become little frequent because we fish them.
Over time, they have a few fish, but we think that's the.
And the question is, why do we accept this?? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, question that it was very different.
And they're going to do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the the way they expect to have the evidence.
So for instance, the anecdotes that some of you present, like captain such as that, and such a look at a lot of fish in this area, can't be used or, usually don't use the scientists of fishing, because it not``scientist . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in embodied societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
So the enormous role that can fulfill a marine marine area . .
Because in protected marine areas, we really recreated the past.
We recreated the past that people can't conceive because the point of departure has been running and it's hugely low . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
That's for the people who can see a marine marine area, and they can benefit from the vision that provides, which allows them to erase their point of departure.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the Middle West, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema maybe can fill the void.
This is a simulation of the Chesapeake Bay.
A long time ago there was gray whales in Chesapeake Bay , 500 years ago.
And you'll have noticed that nuances and tunnels are like``Avatar . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And if you think of``Avatar ,"if you think about what people were made with the movie -- -- talking about Popualities history, why do you take images?
Because it evolves something that, in a sense, has lost lost.
So my recommendation, the only one to give, is Cameron, to``Avatar II"underwater.
Thank you.
Hi . . trends, and I look at YouTube videos.
It's true.
So now we'll see why videos are made viral and what importance has that.
We all want to be stars: celebrities, ,, ,, , when I was younger, that seemed something very ,.
But today the website makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can get famous on the Internet in a sanctity.
There are over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a little percentage is viral, it gets infinite of visit and winning cultural momentum.
How does that happen?
Three things: trend creators, participatory communities and surprise.
Well let me start.
Beau Vasch: : Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!

KA: Last year, Pearl Vercut published this video film outside his house in the National Park Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park . Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows reproduction in the popularity of the summer summer.
Bearn is not proposing to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if you call Mospie Mountain Pearl.
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy Kimmel . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Jimmy Kimmel published this tweet that catacles video to popularity.
The trends of trends like Jimmy Kimmel presents us new and interesting things and they have a broader audience.
Rebecca Black: It's Friday, , Friday . You have to start the Friday . You all want it to the weekend, the weekend ., ,, , . .
\" Friday"of Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it nearly 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Like``Archie rainbow twice ,"this video seemed to have arisen from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And if you ask those other peaks, they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday?
Well, Tom took and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. Nelson, from Martha Science Theater ,.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends of trends embrace a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great internal joke then start talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 pieces of Friday in YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for every one of the other days.
Unlike the U.S. century entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is our how to be part of the phenomenon or doing something new with that.
\" New Cat"is a repetitive animation with a music chord.
That's that, that's all . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This year they saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, ,, , you know there's a three hours that has seen four million times.
Until the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet community community.
There were remix.
Someone made a version of the old.
And then it became international . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
All of a sudden, it was a whole community of remix that made this happen from being a dumb joke to something that we can all form part of.
Because today we don't just enjoy, we participate.
Who could have predicted something like this? . . . . . . . .
Who could have predicted``Architecture rainbow Doman ,"or``Donal Cata"?
What did you get to have written that you would have written this situation?
In a world in which two days of video are uploaded by minute, just that truly unique and unexpected can get out of the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against the in the in New York, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Casey Niger: :, I'm wrong by not not circular by the bike, but often there are obstacles that prevent you right now by biological.
KA: : Thank you to the surprise, and your mood, Casey Ninth made five million saw and understood your idea.
So this approach is worth for everything new that we do creatively.
And this leads us to a big question.
Beau Venter: :? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Ohio.
KA: What does this mean?
The trend creators, creative communities of participatory, ,, which is totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of a new kind of media, from a new culture, that we all have access to and is the the that defines popularity.
As I said before, , one of the in the world, Justin Bieber, started in YouTube.
They don't ask permission to express their ideas . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Now we are a little bit owner of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, they are barely the in the current media, but to define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a finished story . .
It's a puzzle that is still being armed.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece: a man burning the work of a . .
It's a, a playwright, ,, who had an entire life in the unique and freedom of his country.
Imagine as communities enter in Shanghai, facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long friends, now they would.
It was based on silence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It died by the history . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He's my grandfather.
I never met.
But our lives are much more than our memories . . .
My grandmother never allowed me to forget her story.
My task was not to let that have been in vain, and my lesson was to learn that history tried to adapt, but we support it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat when it's delivering quietly into sea.
My mother, Mao, , only 18 when her father died, and a concentrated marriage and two little girls . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For her, life had been destined to a single task: , family and in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that couldn't do it.
And then from a four of four years old who defies fiction, a boat went down to the designed sea ship.
All adults knew risks.
The biggest fear was pirates, rape and death . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Like most adults, my mother had a with poison.
If we were captured, ,, ,, ,, and then she and my grandmother . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, ,, ,, , and the vast and empty horizon . .
I don't remember the pirates that came several times, but they were fooled with men's worth of men in our boat, or the engine dying, and it wouldn't be able to walk for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to finish the journey was too much for him, and the first apple I tried, given by the men of the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, we would get in Melbourne.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations giving a new new together.
We're established in Forber, a classroom of working-class, that population is comprised of immigration . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Unlike the average class suburbs, whose existence, in Forber, there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the rest of the world.
And, the fragments of English English became exchanged between the people who had a common thing: they were starting again . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
My mother worked in farms, , then on a car of cars.
Still, I found time to study English and get an IT title.
We were poor . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
All the dollars were assigned, and established an extra tutor in English and mathematics, ,, ,, that was usually new clothes; . . .
Two media pairs for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform, because I had to last six years.
And there was weird and painful singing singing about the``step eyes"and some graffiti:``Asia, , . ''
At home, where?
Something in me is wrong.
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said ,.
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhausted every night, , but we on our day, and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had nightmares, all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares would start to be able to wake up.
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be an scientist and opened another business.
And women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition, angry and inflection, , and shocked boys between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and sponsors.
They were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds . . .
In one, it was the classic Asia student, implanting with what I sued myself.
In the other one, it was rooted in practical lives, tragically sacrificed by violence, abuse and isolation.
But many of them get help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer, I picked up the Australian girl of the year.
And I went out of a piece of the puzzle to the other, but his edges didn't fit.
So, I was so, an anonymous resistance of Fortune, was now so I, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , never imagined.
I didn't know the protocols . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I didn't know how to use the covered.
I didn't know how to live.
I didn't know how to talk about anything . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I wanted to get to the routine and I wanted to take life in an Igbo suburb -- a -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, telling me about the day in each one and being asleep, the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
He reminded me that I had the the same age that she had when she, when we went to the ship . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The``no"had ever been an option . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
\" Do it ,"he said,``And you don't be what you don't . ''
So I talked about juvenile and education and definition to outcasts and depressing.
And the more frankly I talked, the more was requested to talk.
I met people from all walks in life, many of them doing what they loved, living in the in the border of possible.
And even though I finished my bachelor, I realized I couldn't stay in a lawyer career.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized the same time as it's good to being a stranger, ,, ,, ,, , and not just it's okay, but it's something that I'll be grateful, ,.
Because it's going to be inside, it can easily mean to collapse the horizons, it can easily mean accept the assumptions of your province.
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, that the world is broken, but not the way we fear.
possibilities that had been allowed to be allowed to be were tremendous.
There was an energy there, an unpredictable optimism, a strange and bravery.
So I followed my intuition.
I went together to a little group of people who the motto``can't be done ,"was an irrational challenge.
For a year we didn't have a hundred.
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant soup of soup that we all share.
We worked up at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant, and we opened up.
I made the decision to moving to the America.
After one journey.
My hearts again.
Three months later, I had moved, and the continued adventure.
Before I finish, ,, my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where Congress was social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered.
Life hadn't changed for centuries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He died shortly after she was born.
The mother raised it.
At 17, it became a connection of a Mandarin whose mother would beat it.
No support of his husband, he caused a, and she, she, he's going to take the cause herself, and much more robust caused when she won . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It can't make it wrong.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel hotel in Sydney when she died, to 1,000 miles, in Melbourne.
I looked through the, and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew it had come to leave.
My mother called minutes later . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Forbes, and we sat around their ancestor . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We tell stories and we make sure we were still with it.
At night, a monk came, and he told us he had to close the ancestor.
My mother asked us to feel his hand . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I said to the monkey,``Why is your hand hot, and the rest of the body so cold? ''
Because you've taken your hand from the morning ,"he said.
\" You haven't solved it . ''
If there is a nerve in our family, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Because we were, and how life formed, we can now see that men who had reached our lives would have been frustrated.
The defeat had easily accepted.
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could want that to be?
However, I fear the privilege of the easiest, the right.
Can I give you a set in your lives, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , not guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see it, I would.
TR: It's also the mother of such here today, in the fourth or fifth row . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
My story starts in Rajasthan about two years ago . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I was in the desert, under the star, with the Sufi Shakespeare George Ali.
We were converging how nothing has changed from the ancient Indian epic``The Mahabharata . ''
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a car, and we threw the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes . . .
At that time, when Archie, the great Indian warrior prince, he had silk, he pulled an arc and with a collapse to the floor, he gets water.
Now we do the same with drill and machines.
The conclusion we did was that machinery had replaced magic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And that makes me sad.
I was a little more tech.
I was terrified this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a terrorism if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't tell my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic, not killing it.
As my grandfather, my grandfather gave me his silver relationship.
And this technology of 50 years was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of pirates and in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones, luxury clocks and cameras prevent we are.
They train our inspiration.
So I was launched, I threw this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than killing it.
I illustration books since age 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a device device capable of connecting readers from the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
I'll bring the text with image, animation, sound and touch.
storytelling becomes more and more molecular.
But what would that be?
I'm about to launch John, an interactive application for iPad.
He says,``You put your fingers on every light . ''
And so -- he says,``This box belongs to -- I write my name.
And so I turn a character of the book . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In several times, I get a letter -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl is excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And I don't mean magician and dragons, but to that magic magic of childhood, to those ideas that we're working with children.
For some reason, fireflies in a was always exciting.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to liberate fireflies.
And, really, illuminate your way on what you're looking for.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a girl was that all of a galaxy covered in a pocket . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a ticket that I dragged towards this magical device, within the device . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And it opens a map.
In all fantasy books have always been maps, but they've been static maps.
This is a map that grows up, funeral and guide you during the rest of the book.
At some point in the book, it also reveals.
I'm going to go into it now.
Another hugely important aspect to me is to create Indian content and contemporary.
These of these are the appears.
We've all heard of the fairies and the lions, but how many people outside of India know their Indian counterparts, the goats?
These slums have been trapped in the cameras of Iraq for millennia, ,, an old, book.
So we're bringing them back into a contemporary childhood story.
It's in a story that deals with current topics like environmental crisis.
And, talking about the environmental crisis, one of the last 10 years has been that kids have been locked, attached to their P.C . hasn't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids to the natural world with their technology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to get out of the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images from different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of collections, of sticks, stones, shootings and courts.
For some reason, children don't do it.
So to recover this ritual of childhood, you will go out and, in a chapter, take a picture to a flower and then label it.
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then label it.
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that you then can put on the Web.
A kid from London puts a picture of a fox and says,``Oh, I saw a fox . ''
A child in India says, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And it creates this sort of social network around a a that have been taking.
Within the connections of connection between magic, Earth and technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book, we plan to have an interaction where you're coming out with iPad and video, and augmented reality, and it sees a group of advertisements that appear on the inside of the house.
At a time the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and blow them up to read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature are intertwined with technology and magic and technology to get closer to another.
We harnessed sun's energy.
We're closer to our children and ourselves to ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and love love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of weight projects fail.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University University was to make a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she, she reached a little coffee cup or you and asked patients, family and knowledge: What happens? ''
How can we help?
And we tend to think, that this is one of the most problems for what everybody, or maybe not all, but most of the weight projects fail, because we stopped listening.
This is my Wi-Fi block . It's something very simple.
It has a pool of fire.
Every morning I got up.
And yes, I a challenge as you can see.
I put a challenge to reach 95 kilograms.
But it's so simple, that every time I connect, send my information to Google Health.
And my head doctor has access to him too . So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time that you need cardiology assistance or some urgency of that style, but to look back.
But there's another thing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Like some of you know, I, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi block, and before I went up to my car, people start talking to me: Lucifer, I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure to help patients, that it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be used to move people from their chairs and together develop some recreational activity to have more control of their health . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
From the next week, it will be available.
This little machine connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people could, from their houses, take their blood pressure, send them to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
So this is the point where patients assume a position, they will recover control and to be captains of their own ship, but it can also help us to care about health care because of the challenges that we face face face, like the cost of the costs of medicine care, demand and other issues . . . . . . . . . . .
To perform techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, , but also by crowdsourcing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And one of the things we did wanted to share with you with a video.
We all have navigation controls.
Maybe we have in our phones.
We know perfectly where ATMs in Machine.
It's also where all the gas.
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the the the nearest CEO to helping this patient?
We asked, but nobody knew.
Nobody knows where to get the CEO, saving lives at this moment.
What we did was we did creativity in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to say,``If you see an DES, please send it, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,"and when it's open, they sometimes open up in the time of office.
And over 10,000 Democo, they were presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to search for the for that.
And we did an app for iPad.
We created an app for Lauring, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And every time you're in the in the city of Machine and somebody collapsed, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, to find the closest DEC . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And from today, , I'd like to introduce this one, not just like DARS, which is the the name of the product, but as DNAS.
And we would want to start to start to start it.
We're putting all of all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, work and act as a center for the UNAIDS chromosome around the world.
Every time you're in vacation and somebody's collapse, ,, ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us value these DSA.
You might be a, or people of phone, for example, to see if the CEO that is shown is still in place.
Please help us in this and not just better health, but to take control of it.
Thank you.
I'm here to share my photograph.
Or is it photography?
Because of course, they're photographs that can't take their cameras.
My interest for photography was waking up with my first digital camera at 15.
I mixed with my previous passion for the drawing, but it was a little different because when you use the camera, the was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a a camera, the process ends up when the pulse is pressing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For me, photography had more than to do in the right, at the right time.
I thought anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the pulse.
So pictures like this: a construction in a very transparent road . . .
But it has an unexpected twist.
And despite it, keep a level of realism.
Or pictures like these -- dark and colorful at at once, but with the common goal to keep the level of realism.
And when I regime I mean photographic . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Because, of course, it's not something that can be captured, but I always want it to be captured in some way as photography.
So pictures where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It's got more to do with capturing an idea with capturing a moment.
But what is the the trick that makes them look real?
Are the details or the colors?
Does light intervene?
What creates illusion?
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it's how we interpret the world and how you can perceive in a two-dimensional surface.
It's not really whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly imaginative objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way, you can create something that still seems three-dimensional; as if it exists . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But at the same time, we know there's no.
So we deceive the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining photographs.
It's really changing different realities.
And the things that make a picture looks realistic, , I think they're that we don't even thinking -- things that are around us in our everyday lives . . . . .
But when you combine photographs, it's very important to to consider it, because otherwise something will look bad.
So I'd like to say there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But combined, you can create something like this . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the combined pictures must have the same kind of light.
And these two images with these requirements; they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make the beginning to distinguish the beginning and the end of different images with a perfect union.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is made.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is manipulating.
But this image is completely comprised by photographs of different places . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the personal, I think it's easier to create a place that you find it, because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that you have in your head.
But it requires much planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter knew that I had several months to planning it, to finding the different locations for the pieces of puzzle.
For instance, the fish was captured on a.
The costs are a different location.
The undersea part was captured in a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And yes, I even made a red house the top of the island, so that it looks more Sweden.
So to get a realistic result, , ,.
It starts with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well thought . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If you do a good job when you take pictures, you can be very beautiful and very realistic.
All of the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can put it ...
It's a diagram I took from a folder folder.
I'm not interested so much to show the details, but the general thing.
It's an analysis that we were doing about the the power of the CRISPR microbloggers versus the power networks.
What's interesting about this is that this, like many other things that we tend to see is a kind of straight line in logarithmic scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the performance scale.
Talk about technology with semi-properties is something novel.
So here's something weird . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn up the lights.
It would need more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we create technological curves in logarithmic scales??.
The answer is that if you draw them in a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to do, the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if a farmer, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, . . . . . .
But if something like this happens, it's a qualitative change . .
If the transportation technology would advance as fast as the microprocessors, past tomorrow we could take a cab and be on Tokyo in 30 seconds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But it doesn't move into that pace.
There are no precedent in the history of technological development of a feedback that every few years advanced orders of magnitude.
The question I want to argue is -- looking at these exponential curves, we see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as going.
One of two things happens.
So it will become a typical curve, I know like this until something completely different, or maybe do something like this.
That's what can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I, I think maybe something like that.
It's now in the middle of a transition.
In this line, we are in a transition of what the world used to be to.
So what I try to ask, and ask questions, is, what is that new way that we embrace the world? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?
How new is the?
The transition seems very, very confused if we are immersed in it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I remember the future happened in 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has gone down, year after year, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But I think it's because we feel that something is happening.
We can feel it.
And we know it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years, because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today.
So I want to talk to you about how it could be, how it could be that transition we experience.
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computing.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at the long-term things.
The scale of time I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we went back about 2,500 billion years when Earth was a great sterile rock with many chemicals that were floating around.
If we look at the way that chemicals are organized, we give us an idea how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA . I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and it is that at at that time, I had floating a few oil droplet with all sorts of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet blobs had a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring materials out of the outside and so forth.
And they started dividing.
In a sense, those were the most primitive cell forms; those oil droplet.
But those of those droplets were not alive, in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random chemical recipe.
And every time they divide, they had an unequal distribution of chemicals that they contained.
So each Google was a little different.
In fact, the droplets that were in a way to be better in the time to incorporate the chemicals, they grew up more chemicals and they divide more.
They generally lived longer, they were more represented.
It was a form life, chemical life, very simple, but things were interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
In a way that we didn't understand these droplets very well, they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, they worked in this evolution without sense, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to be able to replicate.
The incredible thing is that the writing system seems to have remained stable since they evolved 250 million years ago . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and code.
And one of the things that I did for fun -- now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 microns of white dust that I try to hide the security people of the airport.
But it has -- I took this code -- the code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and amplified 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have many for all the, in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was a plane, I would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread it out of the room.
What was the next step?
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells are happy another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things were very different, and that these cells started exchanging and communicating information by forming cells of cells.
I don't know if you know it, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So, for example, they evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found how to avoid penicillin, and they took them off to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to form communities that, in a way, they were together in that, and they established a synergy.
That way they survive, or they failed together, or it is that if a community was very successful all of the individuals of that community became more and were familiar for evolution.
And the point of inflection happened when these communities came so close that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all of the recipe of the community together in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage, we have multicellular communities, communities of many types of different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a multicellular community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The cell of the skin doesn't serve without the heart, or the in the muscles, or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell cell, something we call an organism.
The next level happened within these communities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
These started to absorb information . . .
And building very special structures that didn't do more than processing information in community.
They are the neural structures . . structures . .
The neurons are the devices that process information that those cell communities build.
In fact, they started specialized within the community being the responsible structures of recording, understanding and transferring information.
Those were the brains and nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as individuals -- the learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn how not to eat a certain fruit, because it knew bad and it was sick the last time I ate.
That could happen during the life of an organism since they had built these kinds of information processing that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years for the death of individuals that ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system would build those structures of information greatly accelerate the process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication . . .
So for example, the most refined version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a vague idea, in your head . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I'm sitting here by adding a few groups and hopefully building a similar, vague idea, in your heads that you have a certain analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated we turn it into sound, in sound sequences, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as an organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing abstractions.
We now go through similar periods to multicellular organisms; we absorb our research methods, presentation and information processing.
For instance, language invention was a little step in that direction.
The phone, the computer, , the video tape, the CO2, ,, ,, ,, , we're building that information.
And that makes us much bigger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary example of you in which I produced a certain evolution with the Collusion program, in our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time again.
The first stages of the story that were telling you to take a billion years.
The following stages, , the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The following, the language, took less than a million years.
And the following, like electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is feedback;, I, , is the right word to name something that builds its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see that the process feeds.
But I won my life designing computers, and I know the mechanisms that I use to design them would not be possible without recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that connections machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of the Mechanical Thucatory, we think about an abstraction level, we put it in the machine and the machine that does something that you couldn't do before you could, it comes much further and faster than ever before . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put into the in the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of microbes.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We said,``Please computer, can you run hundreds of millions of sequences from random instructions?
Could you run these sequences of random instructions, ,, do all of those programs, and take those that are more about what we want to do? ''
In other words, I what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more close to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, order numbers, so none of them.
But one, thankfully, two numbers in the right order.
And I said,``computer, could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better people did?
Let's look at those and removed the rest.
And now we play the ones that are better ordered.
And we're going back to reproduce it by following a recording process to sex . ''
We take two programs, which are going to get children, who exchange suburbins, and kids inherit the properties of both programs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So we got a new generation of programs from the combination of programs that had a little more success.
And we say,``Please repeat the process . ''
It rating again.
So it introduced some mutations . .
And it tries again and it's about another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So, I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases in a few hours.
At the end, we end up with programs that order numbers in absolutely perfect ways.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written in hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell how it works.
I've tried to analyze it to see how it works . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They are dark, strange programs.
But let's take a result.
I actually know, I have the security that you get the goal, because you come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that you did.
In fact, their lives depended on doing it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And once I was going in an 747 with Marlene Michingel and pulled a card and it says,``Look at this.
It says, , plane has hundreds of thousands of parts that work together to offer a safe flight . . Don't make you feel quiet?? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?.
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to do good design processes.
And that allows us to produce more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the choices that there is.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those those programs to make a lot faster and so much faster, and so we can execute these programs much faster.
So it, it feeds.
The thing goes up faster and so I think it seems so confusing.
Because all of these technologies are feedback.
We're leaving.
And we're at at at an analog moment, when multicellular organisms became multicellular.
We're the amoeba, and we can't understand what the hell is creating.
We're at on the inflection point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we're the the the the the the the the the the the the the final product.
And I think we're all part of the creation of what comes from.
But now comes the lunch, and I think I'll stop here before they eliminated me.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And I've looked at the time enough to allow me to me to me to be part of my false risk in that . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Before I treat my talk, let's talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World Series.
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of surprising statistics . .
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's just coming out``Roward the rules ,"you talk about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'll focus on one of them, and I hope that many of you know it.
It's called battery average.
And we talked about 300, a battery that goes on 300.
That means the baseball baseball effectively, three of 10 times . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
That means to launch the ball to the game field without being caught, and that anyone who tries to throw it to the first base, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Three attempts about 10.
You know how they call a battery in Britain?
Well, really good, perhaps the stars of the stars.
You know how they call a 400 baseball battery? baseball?.
By the way, that's someone that 10 hits, it 4.
Legadema -- like the legendary Ted Williams player, the last Lagos player of baseball in running more 400 hits in a a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Now let's show you this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable, or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose they have apps, and they are dedicated to a surgeon who also has a $400 record.
That doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a remote place and a dear being a dear, has two organized heart arteries and their family doctor, he gave him a cardiologist whose record in Afghanistan is 200.
But you know something?
She's getting better.
They have been 27.
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you believe that you should be the average of the the average of a cardiac surgeon or an orthopedic surgeon, a nurse or a genetic barrier?
1,000, pretty well . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in the whole medicine knows the assets of a good surgeon, a doctor or a paradigm.
What we do, though, is to send the world, and I include, with the mandate of being perfect.
That never, ever, make a mistake and worry to figure out how to good.
That was the the message I absorb when I was in medicine school.
I was an obvious observation student . . . . .
Once, a companion in high school said that Brian Goldman studied to a blood test.
Like.
I was studying in my little couple, in the resistance of General Toronto Hospital, not far from here . . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital . Hospital.
And I learned all of memory.
In my anatomy class, memory the origin and muscle work, the branching of every artery that comes out of the right from the air, the diagnosis differential and not the.
And he even knew the difference diagnosis about how to classify criminal tubes.
And meanwhile, more and more knowledge.
And I was going very well; I graduated with honor . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And from the medical school of medicine with the impression that if I memorize everything, then I would know everything, or the most possible, close to all, because I would improvise mistakes.
And it worked for a, until I I met the Drug lady.
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the the Dr. Draunity into emergency services where I was working.
At that moment, , cardiology service.
And when you're emergency, I'll be able to get a cardiologist to go to a cardiologist, I took that patient.
And to report the chief of residents.
When I saw the Drake lady, I was adding . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I heard a resilient sound.
And when I fought it, ,, I heard a in both sides, which I was in a cognitive heart failure . . .
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pumping blood forward, blood goes to lungs, these are filled with blood, and so there's difficulty to breathe.
It wasn't hard to diagnose.
I did it, and I went to work in the treatment I would give you.
I gave it astronomy and medicine to alleviate pressure in his heart . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I gave it a, ,, ,, ,, , so I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I feel very well . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And that was when I first made, sent her to her.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't pick up the phone, I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and consult it to see it.
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring complicated information.
Perhaps I did for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to a resident that requires constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be as successful and capable of taking responsibility, that could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I sent her to his house, he didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner, and he said, ,, ,, it's not a good idea.
In fact, I was so insecure that I asked the nurse to take care of the,``You think it's okay if you go to your house? ''
And the nurse thought, and then he said completely nature,``Yeah, I think I'm good . ''
I remember that like yesterday.
So he signed up the, and he signed up with the parachutes took her to his house . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, , had a bad presentation in the stomach.
But I followed my work.
At the end of the day, I picked up to leave the hospital and walked into the parking where my car was to go home . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I went through the emergency service at home . .
And there another nurse, not that I care from the Drake lady before, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,.
Other specialists also fear it, but there's a particular particular, and we see the fleeting patients.
The three words are: You remember you?
\" Do you remember the patient that sent your house????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
I asked the other nurse.
\" Well she goes back ,"with the same voice tone.
She was fine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But I went back and at the edge of death.
And I had a time to have come to his house, after I gave him the high, had a collapse and his family called 911; the parks brought it into emergency with an artistic pressure of 50 feet from HG, ,, a . . . .
I just breathe and was blue blue.
The emergency staff sets all its resources.
They gave them medicine to uploading the pressure . .
And they put an artificial breath.
I was shocked and rocked to the.
I had a mixture of feeling because after the established it in intensive therapy and expected to all the hope that would recover.
And in the two or three days, it was obvious to never wake up.
He had an irreversible brain damage . . . . . . . . .
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they were being applied to what was happening.
And the ninth day, they stopped going . The Drug lady, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those people die.
That was my first experience.
The following weeks, I was punished by it and experienced for the first, the bad shame that exists in our medical culture and I, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You do the peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves an teaching.
The moral shame I'm talking about is that makes us feel very bad.
It's the one that tells us not that that we did was wrong, but we're bad . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And that felt.
It wasn't for my boss; he was an charm.
I talked to family, and I'm sure I sort of smooth things and sure that I wouldn't demand.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my boss? Why sent her to his house?
And in my worst moments: ,, made so dumb?
Why medicine chose medicine?
Little bit little to that feeling was spreading.
And I started feeling better.
And in a cloudy day, it opened up the sky, and finally came out the sun, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with myself in which if I was reducing the efforts to being perfect to do not make any more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And so it was.
I returned to work.
But it came back . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Two years later, it was helped in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, ,, ,, with a pain in the throat.
I was very busy.
And he pointed here.
I looked at his throat . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I read penicillin and sent him to his house.
But as he goes to the door, she kept pointing her.
Two days later, when I came to my guard change, my boss asked to talk to me basically in his office.
And I put the three words: Do you remember you?
Remember the patient that he saw by a pain in the throat?
So he came back and didn't have a strategy drug . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He had a potentially fatal condition called selfish . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You can look for Google . It is an infection, not from the throat, but it's the top air, and that can cause the power of those pathways.
He, fortunately, didn't fail.
You get antibiotics for intrinsic, and it's recovered at a few days.
And you go through the same period of shame and reports, then I was relieved and returned to work, until over and over again and again . .
Twice in the same amount of urgency, not diagnosis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And it's a great effort, , especially working in a hospital, since 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a breakfast.
One of them thought I had a criminal calculation.
They order a, but it turned out, a colleague that was checking the patient, perceived some sensitivity in the bottom right, and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot diarrhea.
I order it liquid to retire and asked my colleague to check it.
And I checked it up and I noticed some sensitivity on the bottom right, called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and recovered well.
But every case I was attracting me, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as a lot of colleagues say, it's one.
The most significant ones have been for the last five years.
Only, ashamed and without support . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And here's the problem: , if I I, and I can talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the the voice that really tells me, how could I share this with my colleagues?
How do you teach them to don't make the same mistakes?
If I get into a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about your own mistakes . . . .
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a transformation in my hospital adopted the the wrong leg, believe me that I would have difficulty to look at the eyes.
This is the the system we have.
The full denial of mistakes.
It's the system in which there are two positions: those who make mistakes and not, the ones that can't sleep and the ones that we have, the ones who have results and those who have great results.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, as antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if we move out of medicine to people who make mistakes, we will have a safe system.
But that brings two problems . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical preparation and medical errors to learn what's possible, from the first article I wrote for the Earth Theater to my program,``White Coach, Black Art . ''
And what I learned is that mistakes are ubiquitous.
We work in a system where mistakes happen every day, where one of every 10 drug drugs in the hospital are wrong, or definition is not right . In a system where the hospital-acquired infections are more and more, and more numerous, making chaos and death.
In this country, they die 44,000 Canadian for preventable medical mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes . mistakes
The U.S. Medicine Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about fuzzy understatement, because we're not looking at the problem as we should.
And so there's things.
A hospital system where knowledge is multiplied every two or three, and we don't updated.
The sleep privacy invaded everything.
We can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a a a patient in the chest.
Now, we take the same patient with a pain in the chest, it comes up with colorful eyes and with alcohol to alcohol, and suddenly my story is slowing up.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot; I.
And my patients are not cars . They don't relate their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like us taught us, and we eliminate all the professionals to mistake, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And do people don't want to talk about their most serious cases?
In my program:``white, black art ,"it's a habit to say,``This is my worst mistake ."I would say to everyone,``This is my worst mistake ."I would say to everyone from heart surgery,``This is my worst mistake ,"blah blah blah blah blah,``What are your mistakes? ''
And their students would stop, go back, go down the head and swallow saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, , they want to share them . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You want to be able to say,``Look, they don't make the same mistake . ''
They need a context where we can do it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They need a redefining medical culture . . .
And it starts with a every time . . .
The ridicule doctor is human, , it's human, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , but it's about learning how happened to teach others.
Share their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
It pointed out other people from other people not with the intention to catch them, but in a loving way and support for everyone to benefit.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings are going to run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes occasionally.
My name is Brian Goldman . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I'm a rediscovering doctor . .
I'm human.
And I'm very sorry about learning something that can convey others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three personal words: I memory.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Do you know how much of a week?
I recently did a survey to over 2,000 people and the the average amount of choices that says to pick up a half American, , 70 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Not much, in an research followed for a week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks that are unemployed by these executives and the time they used to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, they collect 13 jobs per week.
Naturally, every work included lots of minerals.
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent require an hour or more of their time . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Now think of their choices . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You know how many of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How does the way that you make those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of today: choose the overload of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and a few possible solutions.
While I'm talking about this, ,, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, like I, raise your hand, just if you want to burn calories . . burn.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, , ,.
And now my first question of the day: Are you ready to hear the problem of the choices overload??????????????????????????????????????????????????
Thank you.
As a graduate student at Stanford University, I was funded this very, very high level -- at least in that time it was very sophisticated.
It's called Dragon.
It was almost like going to a amusement park.
There were about 250 different classes of mustard and vinegar, over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of bottled water, and this was when we had the water of the faucet.
I loved going to that store, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, . .?????????????????????????????????????????????????
This is the the shelf of the olive oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in the sealed box that came from military trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I said,``Well, this strategy of offering all these choices? ''
He pointed to me the bus full of tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to make a little experiment with the limbs.
hallway.
They had 38,000 different classes . . .
We installed a post to argue, right at the entrance of the store.
We put them out there from six flavors, or about 24 different flavors, and we looked at two things: First, what's the case people were willing to stop to try to test the?
More people were stopped when there were 24 , 60 percent, , six , 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a carbon.
Here we found the opposite effect.
What they were stopped when there was 24, ,, ,, just got to buy markers.
What they stopped when there were six, ,, , we saw that 30 percent bought shit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If we do the calculations, people were having six times more likely to purchase if they found six, that if they found 24.
Well, I'll decide that we don't buy perfection, we probably get it -- -- -- it, it's really good to preserve the line, but it turns out that the problem of the choice overload affects us in transcendent decisions.
We decided not not to decide, even when this doesn't convince us . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Now the theme of the day: financial savings.
I'm going to describe you a study that I did with Sun Hubble, to Eat Kangine and Wei Jana, where we see the decision decisions for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds of funds available in savings savings plans, ,, , to save the future.
And we found that there was actually a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We had 65,000 plans that ranged from two, to 50 different choices.
And then we found that the larger number of funding, there was less participation.
So, if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that are offering two funds, participation rate was 70 percent or more, not as high as you would.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funds, the participatory rate declined to 60.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, , when there are more choices, ,, , there are negative consequences . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger the number of choices, the more people were used to avoid stocks or investment funds.
In terms there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we would recommend to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative implications and more possibilities.
The most likely is that it's a decision, that they apply it even when it goes against the interest.
It's more likely to make the worst decisions, in finance and in health.
They're more likely to picking up things less satisfying, even though they are really much better.
The main reason is that we're going to look at that gigantic variety of vast, mustard, vinegar and storm, but we're not able to do the calculations to compare, to contract and choose from that amazing exhibition.
Today, I want to propose you with four simple techniques that we've been testing, in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in your business.
The first one is, cutting.
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say,``Cut . ''
They worry about losing space in the analysis.
But actually, what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut up, get rid of strange choices, there will be an increase in sales, to go down the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When Prozac and Gamble happened from 26 different types of Head and South, ,, , 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Goldman Cat corporation is eliminated by the couple of cats of cats that are less sold, the use of 87 percent, for two causes: greater sales and fewer costs.
It's known that the supermarkets of today, in average they offer 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store, it's about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the current world is Alexand and offers only 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato tomato sauce.
In the world of financial savings, I think that one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the choices is David Labootness's performance, Harvard program.
All Harvard employees are automatically embedded to a insurance of life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Those who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, ,, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say,``I don't know as cut.
They're all important options . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And the first thing I do is ask employees,``Give me the differences that are among those choices.
And if your employees can't difference, you cannot do your customers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This afternoon, before I started this session, I.
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience, a lot of vacation with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Here, a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I want you to read.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to read it and then I want you to give an applause if you're ready to take the supply of Gary.
( Applause applause). Anybody who's ready to accept the supply . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Are they not more?
Well, I'll show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that journey?.
I think that actually I'd hear more hands.
Okay.
In fact, you had more information in the first round, than in the second, but I can focus on and say you thought the second time was more real.
Because images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the choices, which is Connecticut.
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every option, and the consequences must feel very vivid, very concrete.
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit cards that when they use cash?
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that to make you see more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with Shell Benjamin and Alexander President, , Penicillin person who were working on NGOs, and these people were in a meeting where they were affecting a 404 plan.
That meeting, that we were exactly as used, we made a little addition.
What we added was that we beat the staff to think about positive things that happen in their lives if they save more money.
With this mine there was an increase in 20 percent, and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their savings account, from four percent.
The third technique is Clash . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We can handle more categories than choices . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For instance, this is a study we did in a magazine hallway.
And we saw that in the Wagner supermarkets along the northeast edge, the expertise of magazines can contain from 333 different types to 66,000.
But, you know?
Because classification indicates me how to address them.
These are two jewelry exhibitions.
One is called``jazz"and another,``Swiss . ''
If you think that on the left is Swiss and the one on the right is jazz, you get a palms.
( Applause applause). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If you think that on the left is jazz and the right on the right is Songo, you have a past.
Well something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is jazz, and on the right is Swage . But you know something?
This classification scheme is totally futile . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The categories have to indicate something to choose, not that defines them.
You've often seen this problem with those enormous fund lists . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You know who they are informing?
My fourth category: Consteuction complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than what we think, if we just simplify it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a complicated decision; it's buying a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows up completely.
You've got to take 60 decisions, to assemble the car . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that are offering each one.
colors, outside of the car . I have 56 possibilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
engine, , changes . . .
What I'm going to do to do is to vary the order that decisions emerge.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices , 56 colors, a few, four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go from few choices, four boxes , 56 colors, many choices.
And what am I going to look?
How involved you are.
If you act it always the button in every decision, this indicates you're overwhelmed, or it is: we're losing them.
We found that the ones who are going from many choices to time, oppression the button for granted again and again, and again.
We lose them . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If you go from a few choices to many, you keep there.
Same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing I did was to alter the order that information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to choose.
Even though you pick up the change box not to say anything about the preferences of inner decoration, anyway, you prepare us to choosing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We're excited about a product that we're building that we're building that we have more hooked with the process.
So to summarize.
So I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the choices overload: ,, to eliminate strange alternatives -- connected, to make it real, Clash, we can handle more categories with less choices; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
All of these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help handle alternatives, or better, for you, to use them in their issues, or for people who are serving.
So I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful by choosing.
And the more careful we are in our choices will be able to practice the art of choosing.
Thank you.
In the 1980s, in the communist East Germany, if you had a typewriter machine, you should record it to government.
I had to register a piece of text examples written with machine.
And this for government could track the origin of texts.
If they found a writer with the wrong message, they could trace the footprint to the origin.
In the West we didn't think someone could do this, how much that would limit the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries . . .
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer of any big manufacturer, and print a page, that page will end up having some printed yellow dots on every page that is a pattern that makes them themselves and their printer.
That's happening to us today.
And nobody seems to argue about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the net . . . . . .
If we see what happens in the online world, we can clustered the attacks according to their attacker.
There are three main groups.
They are the cybercriminals.
Like Mr. Dimitri glucose in Kiev City, Ukraine.
The cell phone cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to make a lot money, huge amounts.
There are really many cases of online online, milliseconds, who won money with their attacks.
This is Vladimir Tasks, ,, ,.
This is Alfred George.
This is Stephen Watt.
This is Brother Suning . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
These are Matthew Anderson, Alexander and etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their online fortune, but they do it for illegal means by balloons through banking drones to stealing money from our accounts when we online, , or stealing our keys to getting information from our cards when we buy in an infected computer.
The U.S. secret service, two months ago, freezes the Swiss account of this gentleman, Jane, ,, ,, had 13 million dollars when frozen.
Mr. Jain walked up; ; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And I say that today is more likely than any of us is a victim of a cybercriminal that a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from bad.
In the future, most crimes will happen online.
The second group of attackers that we see today is not motivated by money.
There's another thing that moves them, they motivate the protests, they motivate the opinions, they motivate laughter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And groups like Anonymous have doubled over the last 12 months, occupying a role of paper in online attacks.
Those are the three main attacks: criminals that do for money, the packages like Anonymous who do that to protest and the last group is the national states the governments they attack.
And then we see cases like the Dignitre.
That's a good example of government attacks against their own citizens . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
digitization is an authority of certainty from the Netherlands or, actually, it.
I declare the last fall because of a savanna.
They survived the safety of the site, and they would be perceived a cyberattacks.
Last week, I asked, in a meeting with the Dutch government representative, ,, ,, ,, ,, if they were talking about the death of people's death to Digniture.
And the answer of him was.
So how do people die from an attack of these? . .
digitization is a certified authority . .
They sell certificate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What do the certificates serve?
Well, you need if you have a website with athletes, self-engineering services, services like Gmail.
Except, they are an foreign certified authority.
And they run apart certificates.
And the case of digitization happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for instance in Egypt?
Well, in Egypt, the protesters got the headquarters of the police secret police in April 2011, and during the building of the building, they found many papers.
And among those papers was this titled folder``FDA . ''
And within that folder there, there was notes from a company with headquarters in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept large-scale communications in the country's citizens.
They had sold this tool for 200,000 euros to the Egyptian government.
The headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to totalitarian governments to do this to their citizens.
But the Western governments also do this themselves.
For instance, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, the was found the Studenth Transition, a using German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a good criminal case, it pretty obvious that your phone is embedded.
But today, it goes beyond.
The Internet connection is introduced.
Use even tools like the Science Transition to infect our computer with a transportation to allow you to see all the communication, and hear the online discussions, to get our data.
When we think about things like these, the obvious answer should be,``Well, it seems something bad, but I don't really affect because I'm an honest citizen . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Why worry?
I have nothing to hide . ''
And that argument has no sense.
It's playing privacy.
The privacy doesn't argue.
It's not a question of privacy against security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's about freedom against control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right we're going to give up today, to be forever.
Do we rely on any future government, in an administration that we could get within 50 years?
These are the questions that you should worry about in the next 50 years.
So here's where I live ., in the south of Nairobi National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, to the background, ,, , National Park Park.
The National Park of Nairobi has not close to most of the south, which means that wild animals like zebras migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like lions, follow them, and this is what they do . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They kill our livestock . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is one who killed at night, and so soon we got up in the morning and we found it dead, I felt very bad, because it was the only bull we had.
My community, the, we, we believe that we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to push them, and so we value them so much.
So I grew up hating lions.
They are warriors that protect our community and livestock, and they're also upset with the problem.
So kill lions.
This is one of six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there is so a few in Nairobi National Park.
A child in my community, , at six at nine, is responsible for his father's livestock, and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions gave them fear.
But I realized that actually this doesn't work, because even helped lions to see the stable.
I didn't quit . It continued.
One second was to use a spirit.
It was trying to deceive lions so you thought it was near the stable.
But the lions are very smart . They came to the first day and saw the spirit, and they were, but the second day, they went back and said,``This thing doesn't move, it's always here ., . ''
So one night was walking around the stable with an torch, and the lions didn't come.
I found that lions have fear to light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got an switch that I'm going to learn and and turn the lights off.
And this is a little light light lamp.
I was all.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery supply electricity to the little Indian box.
And the Indian box makes lights left.
As you can see, the light bulbs go outside, , from where lions come from.
And this is how lions see when they come from night.
The lights flash and fooled lions to think that I'm walking around the stable, but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had been killed by the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
I put them . You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea also is used now all over Kenya, to encouraging other predators as an hyena, leopards, and it's also being used to stress elephants from farms.
So thank you to this invention, I had the fortune to get a grant in one of the the, Kenya International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funding and awareness.
I even led my friends to my community and installed lights in houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to put them.
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the meadows of in the savanna, by showing my father's cows, and I used to see airplanes fly, and I was telling me that someday would be within one.
And today I am.
I got a chance to come in for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to being an engineer of aviation and pilot when it grows . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving my dad's cows and lions, we can be with the lions without any conflict.
Assemble smell . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Chris Anderson: You don't imagine how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you get a scholarship . Richard Turner: Yeah . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
CA: You're working on other electric inventions . . .
What is the next on your list?
RB: My next invention is -- I want to make an electrical fence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .? . . . . . .? .? .?.
RB: I, you invented electric fences, but I want to do mine.
CA: already tried, right?
We're going to give you on every step that you know, my friend.
Thank you very much . JT: Thank you.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called``No envy envy . ''
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spend all time studying the story of Kim Eighth, , but we never learned much from the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
But sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I'd spend my whole life in North Korea, until it all of suddenly changed.
When I was seven, I saw my first public execution.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal . . .
My family was not poor, and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister's colleague.
And he said,``When you read this, the five members of family will stop existed in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We're stuck together on the, and our bodies are so weak, we're prepared to die . ''
I was very upset . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the very little time, when I walked in front of a train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, , holding a child climbing in his arms looking at his mother's face without being able to do anything.
Nobody helped them, because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge tribute to North Korea in North America.
At the end, over a million Koreans died during hunger and only few survive eating grass, insects and tree.
They also became more and more frequent, , all of my energy cuts, all around me was completely dark at night except by sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I always wondered why they had light and us not.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to neighboring countries.
This is the Arajeric River, which is a limits between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very upset at certain points, , enabling nerves to self-device.
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I can't reveal the details of how North Korea came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of hunger, sent China to live with distant relatives.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life as a North refugee.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because North Koreans in China were considered illegal immigrants.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealed, and would be repeated to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually made, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and introduced me in police station.
Somebody had been accused to be North, then they tested my skills in Chinese language and asked me a lot questions.
I was terrified . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be created and reported.
I thought my life was going to finish.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered questions.
At the end of the interrogation, an officer told another one,``This was a false report . She's not North . ''
And they let me go . It was a miracle.
Some Koreans in China look for asylum in foreign embassies.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese and sports police.
These women were very lucky . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Although they had captured them, they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and reported to North Korea, where they are tortured, incarcerated or executed.
Although I was lucky in escape, many other North Koreans haven't been lucky.
It's tragic that the Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can turn into an instant.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, ,, , I decided to arrive at South Korea.
And I start a new life again.
To be taught in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a great gap between North and South.
We're all Korean, but within, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of division.
Even a crisis of identity.
I am South or North?
Where am I? Who am I??? . . .? . . .? . . .? . . .? . . .? .? . . .? .? . . .? .? .? . .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?.
Suddenly, there wasn't a country that could call me.
Though I'm going to adapt to life in South Korea, it wasn't easy, I made a plan . I, I, I started studying the engineering exam to University.
Just when I began to adapt to my new life, ,, I received an alarming call . .
The North Korean authorities interact some money that sent my family, and as a punishment, my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location that was remote outside.
They had to dive immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
The Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible crossing the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China, and I loved the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't talk Chinese, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , over 3,000 miles across China and then in the Southeast Asia.
The bus in bus took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
I asked all of, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I my family was going to be arrested.
When Chinese officer came up to my family, I got up to my family, and I told him, and I said, they were sort of set people who was taking.
I looked at it suspicious, but unfortunately I.
We did all the way to the Laden border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Lagos.
But even after I passed the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned to cross the border illegally.
After paying crutches and bribery, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the Lakes capital.
So this was one of the lowest dots in my life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I did everything for liberate my family, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, but my family was retreat in prison in the last South Korean Embassy.
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribery or billions . . .
I lost hope.
At that moment, ,, ,, ,, ,? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I was so surprising that an unknown stranger would care.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without doubt, the man was to the ATM, and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two North, and out of prison.
I'll thank you with all my heart, and I said,``Why do I help me? ''
\" I'm not helping you ,"he said.
\" I'm helping the North people . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ''
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The nice unknown symbol of a new hope for me and for the, when we needed it.
And I showed that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community is really the hope hope hope that North people need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving your freedom is just half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and when they came up to a new country, they start with little or nothing money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, the practice of English language, working practice, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the world.
Because many of us are in contact with familiar, and we send information and money that's helping to change North Korea from inside.
I've been very lucky, I, and I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, ,, ,, to a chance to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more Koreans triumph around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Centre.
This is the South Center: light stores, fast food, balloons.
And then the city planner came together and thought, we're going to change the name of South Central Center to represent something else, so they changed it to the South Angeles, as if this will fix what's actually wrong in town.
This is the South Angeles.
Like 265 million other Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles Centre, home of food places to take and eat in the car . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The curious thing is that the food places to make more people killed than food in the car.
People are dying from curable diseases in Los Angeles Centre.
For instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than, ,, ,, , 15 kilometers away . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I'm glad to see this happen.
And I wonder, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, ,, ,, ,, ,, , you see the that the current food system has in their neighborhood?
I see chairs of wheels compressed and sold as cars used.
I see centers of cultural dialysis like Starbucks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And consider this must stop.
Knowing that the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
Now, I'm also able to manage 45 minutes away and come back to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, was planted a forest forest in front of my house.
In a land of land we call a gardening.
It's 45 feet three.
The point is that belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said,``Well, I can do what comes to me in win, because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it . ''
This is what I did.
So my group and I, L.A. Green Group, we, we came together and started planning our food forest, fruit trees, you know, the nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we, we're kind of a group paid by advanced by gardeners from all of the, from all the city and completely voluntary, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone complained.
The city came to me, and in summary gave me a computer saying that I had to remove my garden, the titanium was made by court.
And I said,``Come, right?
A judicial order to plant food in a nobody cares?? care? ''
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steven Loam, , and he talked to the content and one of Green Groups members, who put a request in Changing , 900 signatures, we, we.
We had the victory in our hands.
My focus even called to saying that they would breathe and adore what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with more buckets.
It's 68 kilometers of blue terrain.
That's 20 Central Central Park . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
That's enough space to plant 72.5 million tomato plants.
Why don't the hell have you right?
Growing a plant to give a thousand , 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of haiku will give you 75 dollars of output.
It's my hymn, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Growing your own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up there . I raised my children there.
I'm glad to be part of this manufacturing reality that was manufacturing for me for others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm artists.
The gardening is my graffiti, I grow my art . . .
Like an artist of graffiti, that goes up walls, I'm eating soils, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I use the garden, the land, ,, ,, and the plants and the trees, are my celebrity of that canvas.
They would be surprised to see what the land can do, if they let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how astonishing a sunflower is and how people are affecting.
What happened?
I'm a witness of how my garden became a tool of education, my neighborhood transformation.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We're the Earth . . .
It would be surprised to see how kids affect kids.
gardening is the most therapeutic and provocative act that you can do, especially in an urban.
Also, you get strawberries.
I remember an occasion, who came a mother and his daughter, were like 10,000 at night and they were in my yard, salt and looked very carefully.
I, good, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is in the street for a reason . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I felt shame when I saw people who was so close to me with hunger, and it just references why I do this, people ask me,``Well, ,, don't fear people steal your food? ''
I say,``Oh God no, I'm not afraid you'll steal . ''
So it's in the street.
That's what it is.
I want you to take it, , but at your time, I want you to leave your health . ''
There was another time that I put a garden in a deforestation shelter in Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was fabulous, , they shared her stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant with her mom and grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so just for a moment.
So Green Grove has come to plant maybe 20 gardens.
We've had, like 50 people who come, work and participate, all in volunteer plan.
If kids grow color, kids will eat color.
If you grow tomatoes, you'll eat tomatoes . But if none of this is taught, if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and body, you eat blind what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they're stuck in ., ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
With the gardening, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are charged from their communities to having a . . . life . life . life . life . life . life . life . life . life . life . life . life . life . life . life . life . life . life . life . life . life . life.
And when we do this, who knows?.
Maybe the next George Washington Court.
But if we don't change the composition of land, we will never do.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into healthy coffee . .
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free things, because free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability is you have to hold it out.
What I'm talking about is to put people to work, take people out of the street, that you know the joy, the pride and the honor to grow their own food, open up farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to do sexy.
I want you all all to become evolutionary and exploded, garden gardeners.
We have to change the script of what a management is.
If you're not a gardening, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
That gestures take their agenda.
That's their choice weapon . . .
In sum, if you want to meet me, well, if you want to see me, they don't call me, don't they call me sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some shit -- to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your stick, so we can plant something.
Peace . Thanks.
Thank you.
( Marketing sound) -- you'll probably everybody agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of asphalt, and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, in which it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that's out.
And especially if you go to the in your bike, and these cars go through, that is not really nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we want a silent road.
The solution for that is to make porous features.
The porous asphalt, a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands of the Netherlands, has pores and the water can go through it, so all the rain water flow into the side and have a road that it's easy to drive, and they won't make water to any more.
The noise will also disappear in these pores.
Because it's very hollow, all noise, so it's a very silent road.
It also has disadvantages, , of, of, of course, and the downside of this road is that you can get rid.
What is it going to take away? You see that in this road, the stones of the surface are coming out.
First one stone, then several more and more and more and more and more, and then -- well, I'm not going to do that . But you can give it his windshield, and not happy with that.
And finally, this may also bring more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create bacteria with that . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Ah . It's ready . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Bach, of course, that you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can see here really how damage comes in this material.
It's a porous asphalt, , as I said, just, it's just a little bit of an adolescent between stones.
Because of the Internet, , to the light, this adverse, this little baby, the glue between the wheels, will be picked, and if you get up, you're going to get microbes and separated from the agendas.
So if you drive through the road, you'll pull the add -- like we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about materials of self-organization.
If we can make this material self-assemble, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use steel wool, that to clean up, and we can cut up the steel wool in very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the.
So we have asphalt with little pieces of iron wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to cook -- an industrial machine.
The induce can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel, melt the car, ,, ,, ,, and rocks will come back to the surface.
Today, I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the big driver of input here to stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm now going to take to see what happened.
This is the showing you now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat samples.
We tried a lot of samples there and then government, they really saw our results, and they thought,``Well, that's really interesting . We have to try it . ''
So we were donated by a piece of road , 400 meters from the Aphica highway, where we had to do a to test to this material.
So that was what we did there . You see where we were doing the test test, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage . That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of charge in them, ,, , we repair them after our induce machine and we repair them, and we went back to test.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel fibers, incorporating these fibers, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . . tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious if this also worked . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We still have it here . It's pretty hot.
In fact, you have to face first before you can show how repair.
But I'm going to make an attempt.
Let's see . Yes, it work.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I, I remember waking up a morning with the sound of my house in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News in his little gray radius . . .
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual in those times, because news usually depressed it.
\" The Taliban went! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I didn't know what it meant, , but I could see my father was very, very happy.
\" Now you can go to a real school ,"he told me.
One morning I'll never forget.
A real.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban would be applied to Afghanistan and they did illegal that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I looked like a child to escort my older sister, who could no longer be outside, to going to a secret school.
It was the only way we could two we could educate us.
Every day, we had a different route, so nobody could suspect where we were.
We had to hide the books in market bags so that we were going to buy shopping.
School was in a house, over 100 of us stuck in a little room.
It was nice in winter, but extremely hot in summer.
We all knew that we risk our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Occasionally, school was closed to a week, because the Taliban suspected.
We always wondered what they knew about us.
Were they following us?
Did you know where we live?? .?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
We were terrified, but still, school was where we wanted to be . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I was very lucky to growing in a family where education was appreciated and the daughters.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A total proxy of a remote province of Afghanistan, I insisted that his daughter, ,, ,, and that his father repeated it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But my educate mother became teachers.
This is it.
It's going to retire two years ago, just to convert our house in school for girls and women of our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that his children had to getting education, ,, ,, ,, ,, despite risks.
For him, there was a greater risk of not to their children.
Over the years of the Taliban, I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated by our life and I was always scared and didn't see a future.
I wanted to quit, but my father said,``Hey, my daughter, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But there's one thing that always will be with, what is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So do you still want not to continue? ''
Today I'm 22.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war . . . .
Less than six percent of my age's women have more than the barber, and if my family would have been so committed to my education, I.
Instead, I, I'm proud of graduating in mysterious Miller College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was exploded from his home to educate his daughters, was one of the first to congratulate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He didn't just get rid of my university title, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . streets.
My family believes.
I dream in big, ,, , . family.
That's why I'm the global ambassador of 101, a to educate women.
It's for what USFA, the first, perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see his parents and his families that, ,, ,, ,, ,, , ,.
And like Ahmed . It's not its true name, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were going to walk from SOPA to his village, ,, ,, ,, ,, , for minutes.
When you get to your house, you're the the phone, , a voice was warned that if you keep sending your daughter to school, you will try it to.
\" Let me look at me, if you want ,"he said,``But I won't give the future of my daughter for their old, relaxing ideas . ''
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those of those of those of us, there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling interruptions of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need men's support.
Under the Taliban, the girls who went to school to count in hundreds -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I'm afraid these changes don't sleep much, after the U.S. troops retreat.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who are advocating for them, that animate them, , I, I see a future and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of specific hope and possibilities, and every day, the SLL girls remind me . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Like me, they're very large.
Thank you.
Never, I've never forgotten my grandmother's words that died in the exile,``daughter, resist Gaddafi . struggle.
But you never become a Greenland style Gaddaline . ''
They've spent almost two years since it was the Libya revolution inspired by the smell of massive mobility, as much of the in the Tunisian Revolution.
A force with a lot of other liberate citizens, inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against Gaddafi's surgical regime.
And we did it;, it a great revolution.
Women and young baby men were in the the, on the middle of, excepting each of the regime, carrying freedom farms, dignity and social justice . . .
They've shown a courage to get the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi.
They've shown a from the East East, to west west, to south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a bunch of loss of roughly 50,000 dead war, we managed to release our country and defeat the tyrant.
However, Gaddafi left a burden heavy, a, corruption and self-worth.
For four decades, the surgical regime of Gaddafi destroyed infrastructure, and culture and moral structure of Libya society.
aware of the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted, together to many other women, rebuild the civil civil society, demanding an inclusive and fair transition towards democracy and national reconciliation.
They were established about 200 organizations in Benki during, ,, ,, ,, about 300 in tropical . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya, and with a unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops about developing capacity, and leadership skills.
So with an incredible group of women, we founded the League Women platform for peace, a movement of women, leaders, of very diverse orientation, to advocate for the political autonomy of women and by our of our equal participation in building democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the prehistoric period, an environment that was increasingly polarized, which is moved from selfish policy and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won 17 percent of the National Congress in the first choices in 52 years.
However, very little, the elation of choices and revolution as a whole, were disappearing; every day we find violence news.
One day we're waking up with the news news of the ancient mosques and graves.
Another day, I loved the killing of the American Embassy and attack.
Another day we wake up with the news of the army's office killings.
And every day, every day we wake up with the government of the military and their continued rape of the human rights of prisoners and their lack of law respect.
Our society, for a revolutionary mindset, is polarized, and it's gone away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
Interaction, exclusion and revenge became the cones of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire them with our history of the``regret lists ,"and choices.
But I'm here today to trust that we, as a nation, we, we, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize.
Because choices didn't bring peace, stability and security to Libya.
The crime list and alternative between candidates and candidates brought peace and national reconciliation?
No, did.
What happened then?
Why does our society go on and mastered with selfish policies of domination and exclusion, for men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not just women, but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.
Our society needs national dialogue and belief creation more than the choices needed, that they only reinforce polarization and divide . .
Our nation needs the fundamental representation of more than need the numerical and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting like outrage agents and calling the anger days.
We need to start acting like agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which not not just honor, but also put to practice the mission instead of revenge, the collaboration instead of competition, the inclusion instead of exclusion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, , depressed by war, needs desperately to reach peace.
Because peace has a alchemy that's about interconnection and disruption between feminine perspectives and males.
That's the real cruel . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it in a social form . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And according to a version of the``Salaam"-- the, the peace --``is the word of the God miserable, [. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At the time, the word``Ramar ,"which is known in all the Abrahamic traditions, has the same root in Arabic that the word``Ramin"-- uterus -- and sharing the feminine and material, which underlies all the humanity of the men and women, that all tribes and all the peoples have ever come.
And so, just like the uterus completely cover the embryo, which grows inside, the divine matrix of the number of compassion of the number.
This is what we say to,``My mercy covers all of the things . ''
This is what we say,``My mercy from my anger . ''
That all of the grace of the mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about an early question, , which has an equally disturbing answer . .
It's the secrets of domestic violence, and the, and the question I'm going to address is the one that everybody always asks: ,? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?.
Why would someone stay with a?
I'm not a psychologist, no social workers, or a domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I was just license at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first work as a writer and editor in Steven magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green American card, and I had a very large secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my twin soul, was pointing on my head with a gun, loaded with a bank battle.
The man, that I loved more than anyone in this world, put a pistol in my head and threatening to get married than I can remember.
I'm here to tell the story of crazy love, a, a psychological trap, where you fall in every year millions of women, and even some men . ., ., . ., . ., . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It might be his story.
I don't feel a typical survival of domestic violence.
I'm an English University of Harvard University, and I have an MBA in Maryland from the Whale Business School.
So I've spent most of my career working for companies of the list``Fifty 500 ,"between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo Burmarr and Washington Post . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I spend almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black hole, and leading a Ministrician Honest Opening . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anybody, , all of race, all religion, all of the levels of realistic and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a woman problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the are men, and domestic abuse only happens in intimate, independent and long relationships, or, I said, in a different way, in families, the last place where we want or hope to find violence, the reason that domestic abuse is so puzzling.
I myself would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who would paste him, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
And it was 22, and in the United States, the women between 16 and 24 have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, boyfriend and abusive husbands in the United States.
I was also a, because I knew nothing about domestic violence, , their warning signals or patterns.
I met Congo in a cold and rainy night.
I was sitting next to my side in the subway in New York and began to fly with me.
He said two things.
The first one was that he also had just been license from a university of the Slow Lego and worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most in that first encounter was that it it was smart and fun, and it seemed a guy from the field.
I had a couple of big models like apples, and a wheat red hair, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the more intelligent things he did, from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it about everything at the first by putting on a pedestal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We started coming out and loved all of me: ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, that I had a passion to help girls, and my work.
I wanted to know about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
I've believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done.
And that was why the receiver in that prestigious school and in Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance for him . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence relationship is to seduced and make the victim.
And I didn't know that second step is isolate.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to make sacrifice for your partner, , I, ,, and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a, ,, which was entering head in a physical, financial and psychological trap, carefully prepared.
The next step in the a domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence to how it reacted.
And here's where they get into a scene that these pills.
As soon as we moved to New England, you know, that site where I, I that I, I had to feel so sure three pills.
One had one of the in the car.
It's another one of the, under the pillow in our bed and third, always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those these pills that he lived from small.
I needed them to feel safe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But those pills actually were a message for me and, even though I had never raised my hand, my life was already in danger, every single minute.
The first physical attack of Congress happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and there was still the truck.
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I my mother's boyfriend and married me.
Even though I had happened, , I was sure we were going to live happily forever, because I loved it, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very ,.
There was simply very big sense of the, and in fact to form a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and it would never make me harm . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I spent twice in our mind.
The first time I was driving towards a secret beach and lost me, and he gave me so hard in my head that I, versus the car window.
And then a couple days later, driving back from our honey moon, it was drunk by the traffic, and I took a, Mac cold.
Now, he continued to give me one or twice a week for the next two and a half years.
I was wrong when I thought it was the only in this situation.
One in three American women is victims of domestic violence or harassment at some moment in their life, and the Centers of diseases reported that every year 15 million children are killed , 15 million . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why did I stay?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know that he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply tormented man, and it was the only person in the world that could help him face to his demons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The other question that everybody asks is: Why don't you just get to?
Why didn't I go? I could have gone to any time . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And for me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we, the victims, we know something that you normally ignore: it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a juggler . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Because the last phase in the domestic violence pattern is to kill it . . violence.
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence, after the victim has put to the relationship, after it's going, because then the abuse has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include the permanent harassment, even after the abuse has come back to marry, density of financial resources, and manipulation from the family law system to land the victims and their children, who are usually forced by judges to time, ,, ,, who would be paid.
And we still keep asking why,``Why don't you go? ''
I was able to go, because of one last silence I sold my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, would have killed me if I had allowed it.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone, the, to the police, to my neighbors, to my friends and family, to complete strangers, and I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to stereotype victims as the superstring headlines, self-destructive women, damaged goods.
The question,``Why do you stay? ''
It's a way to a way to say,``The fault is yours to stay, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , ,"as if the victims we're choosing intentionally in love with men who want to destroy.
But since I published``crazy love ,", I, ,, I've heard hundreds of stories of stories and women who also escaped, that they learned an unstable lesson from what happened to them, and they would gather their lives, weaker and mothers, completely free lives of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that actually I am a victim and a very typical domestic violence.
I became married with a and friendly and we have those three children.
I have that black hole, and also that miniature . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What I won't have ever more, ever, is a charged pistol pointing on my head in someone who says that I want.
At this moment, they're thinking,``Hello, that's fascinating!, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I guarantee you are a few people, that you're listening to me right now, which are being battered or that they were small or that they are abused themselves.
The marathon could be affecting his daughter, , sister right now.
I was able to put my crazy particular love love with the silence.
I keep doing that today.
It's how to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse just just in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply throwing light over it.
The victims need everyone.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They take the the, they take the to light talking about it with their children, their jobs, their friends and family.
They represent their vision of survivors as fantastic and charming people who have a full future.
They will recognize the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their scale and show victims a safe output.
Together we can convert our beds, our tables and our families in the safe, peaceful oasis that should be.
Thank you.
Hi . My call me Cameron Russell, and for a while, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
To be accurate, for 10 years.
And I feel that at this point there is an awkward tension in the room because it shouldn't be dressed like this . Luckily, I.
So this is the first laundry change on a TED stage, so you're very lucky to present it, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If some of the women were horrified when he came up, they don't have to tell now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everyone has that opportunity.
These heels are very uncomfortable; less bad I do I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to spend this sweater, because it's when they're going to laugh at me, so do nothing while I cover my head.
Okay.
Why have I?
It's been embarrassing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Well, , I hope.
The appearance is powerful, but also surface.
I've changed what you thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a.
I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer told me to grab the back and pull the camel of the kid.
Of course, with surgery, or an artificial tan like the one that made me two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform our way, which, while surfaces and unchanging, has a great impact in our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I am model.
Because I'm a nice and white woman, ,, ,, , that is a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but it's a good.
The first question is, how does it be model?
And I always say, a kite discovered me, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I was making me model is because I win the genetic lottery, and I'm the benefit of a, ,, and you're wondering what this heritage is.
Well, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as health, , youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to admire, we also associate it to a high and stable shape, to womanhood and a white skin.
And that's my inheritance, ,, I I I.
And I know that there are people in the audience that now is skeptical, and maybe there's some lovers of the fashion that you say -- wait . There's Naomi, Turkey, Joan Sams, Lithia Wei.
First, the happiness to know so much of models . It's surprising.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told all of the and every single model in the runway, and from 67 controlled models, only 27, it is less than four percent, they weren't white.
The next question that people always ask me is: could be a model when it's older?
And my first answer is: I, I don't love that.
But then, what I would really tell each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the the United States, or the the the the, or the the the, or the, or the next Internet, or a non-specific, which would be awesome, because you're the first one.
If after this spectacular list, they still insist, no, no, Cameron, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the the the reduction chief of the American Voice magazine or the an executive director of H &, or next Steven Mexico.
To say that most of you want to be model, it's like saying you want to win the lottery when you get older.
It's outside your control, it's surprising, and it's not a work you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike cardiac surgery, it can be summed right now.
I don't know what happened there.
And unfortunately, once you've finished your studies, and you have a curriculum and a few jobs to your backs, , no matter what you say, , that is, if you say you want to be president from the United States, but your resume said,``inner clothing model for 10 years, people would look weird . ''
The next question that people always do is whether all of the pictures were collected . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And yes, you're pretty much collected all the pictures, but that is just a little bit of what happens.
This was the first picture that took me, and also the first time I used a bikini, and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal terrain, but it was a girl.
And so my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a pajamas of pajamas a few days before pictures for the French Voices.
Here I am with my football team and in the magazine.
And this is me at the present.
And I hope you realize that I'm not in those pictures.
They're creations of a group of professionals, peel, machines, photographers and statistics, and all of their help and protection people, and they get to create this . That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: Do you get things free?
I have too much 20 minutes and I never use, except the early couple, but the privilege that I get to get in real life, and we don't like to talk.
I grew up in Cambridge, , and once I went to a store, and I forgot to take money, and they gave me free.
When I was a teenager, , I traveled with my friend who was a primary driver;, , a and, of course, and, of course, they stopped us, and I was a feeling, agent to be able to keep driving.
I enjoy these privilege for my aspect, not for what I am, and there are people who are paying a price for their sense without matter who are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the 140 teenage people who were stopped and recorded , 86 percent black and Latino, and most of them were young men.
And there are only 170 black and Latino in New York City, so for them, is not a question of they would stop me?
But how many times would you stop me? And when?
When I research for this talk, ,, , I, ,, ,, ,, , 13 percent of 13 years in the United States, you don't like your body, and that number goes to 78 percent at 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer they expect is: :, ., ,, you'll feel very happy and great.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it looks like.
So we say, it's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative, resourceful and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said in front of them, is: I . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And I am because I have to worry about my life every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, do you get more thin legs and hair brighter, will be happier?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most thin legs, the brightest hair and the, the most brilliant hair, but they're probably the physically most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly, it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender oppression when I am one of the biggest benefits.
If there is something that will come from this talk, ,, , ., ,, , and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was older enough to get a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more precious pictures, and I didn't be me who took them.
There were no artistic directors, no status, , no opportunity to repeat the photos, ,, in illumination.
And in fact, most of them took random tourists.
My story starts when, , finding in New York City to give a, , my wife took me this picture by holding my daughter in the day of her first birthday . That's the spirit of 57 and five.
I gave up the chance that we went back to New York, just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter said to me, my wife said,``Why don't you take Siberia to New York in a paradigm journey and on the ritual? ''
This is when we started asking the tourists to happen that we would take out the picture.
It's surprising that the gesture of taking the camera to a a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, , no one has ever gone to the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life this journey would change.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after 9/11, and I had to explain to my daughter who had happened that day that a five-year-old could understand it.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a in a week of October and we're going to keep us reflect over our time and of our evolution over the years, and not just physical level, but in every sense.
Because even though we've always got the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter comes up with new milestones, and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of the, we were walking, when suddenly, it was stopped in dry and pointed out a red tunnel of the wrist store that I'd had a little bit of young in previous visits.
And I was describing what was at five years of foot in that same place.
I thought he would remember his heart beating, and he would see that place for nine years.
And now what he looks in New York are universities, because he's decided to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are memories.
So I want to share the idea of engaging actively in conscious creation of memories.
I don't know you, but besides these 15 pictures, not a lot of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who takes the picture.
Today, I want to encourage you all to go on the picture, and don't lead to somebody and ask yourself,``Does a pulled us up? ''
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world . . .
The guys are in the most threatened bird group . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
First, why do they have so bad press?
It has also been associated with Disney laughter personalized characters like mental, silly ,.
More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press, , applause and claims, these are the attributes that are associated with Kenyan parliament, but I don't accept it.
Don't accept it . You know why?
Because the parliament members don't keep clean the environment clean, the parliament don't help prevent the disease spread.
They are definitely monogamous . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There are the New World City that are mainly found in the Americas, like the condoms and the faces, and the the the the the old World World, where we have 16 species . Of these 16 , 11 are facing a high risk of extinction . . .
So why's the, why are the guys important? First of they provide vital ecological services.
It's our natural garbage readers.
They wipe up the carcasses to bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria . They help absorb the anthrax that not to be for them to them, and it would cause large losses of livestock and diseases in other animals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no, the carcasses are three to four to four times more time to decompose, and this has huge features in spreading disease . . . . . . . . . . . .
They also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient Egyptian culture.
New was the symbol of the instructor and the materiality, and, along with the cobra, they symbolic the unit between the Alto and down.
In the Indian mythology, Kazakhstan was the the the, and he risked his life to save the Singapore Damage devil of 10 heads.
In the Tibetan culture, you get a lot of important things in open sky . In places like Tibet, there is no place to bury dead, or wood to believe them, so these books provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with the bubble?
We have eight species in Kenya, which six are in extreme threat of extinction.
The reason is that they're being poisoned, and the reason that they're being poisoned is because there are conflicts between humans and fauna.
In the south Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of bubble are in the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years will be extinct, and the reason is because they fall out of the livestock consumption that has been treated with an analog drug like Dicordic.
This drug has been banned for veterinary use in India and have taken a posture . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Since there are no, ,, there's been a spread in the number of dogs dogs in carcasses of carcasses, and when you have street dogs, you have a huge time bomb bomb . . . .
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in Africa: , to the top of the Lake Turkana . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, , because wind turbines do this to birds . They cut them in half.
They are birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of dead bus to serving the border and the meter.
So what is it doing? . ,.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We can see that they travel through different countries, so focus on a local problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the bubbles, the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that they provide.
How can they help?, ., ., ., ,, ,, , ,.
When you go out of this room, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, with your children, . . . . . . . . .
They're very elegant . . ,.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you.
Every thing that I do, and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been shaped for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
Since 1971, to 1977, I'm like, I'm not . I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Catholic Castroson, Algeria and Somalia, in technical cooperation with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every project we established in Africa failures.
And I was petrified.
I thought, at age 21, that Italian were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we do is we that we played.
Our first project, which inspired my first book,``Zambiad waves ,"was a project where some Italian, we decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we came up with Italian seeds south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that goes down to the Zambia River, and teach the locals to grow Italian tomatoes and calories, and ...
And of course, people weren't at all interested in doing that, so we paid them to come to work, and sometimes, they didn't do . We were amazed that the locals, in such fertile valley, hadn't had agriculture.
But instead of wondering how it was possible that they didn't grow anything, we just said,``Thank God we are here ."`` Right to save people from famine Zambia . ''
And, of course, everything in Africa is growing beautifully.
We get these magnificent tomatoes . In Italy, a will grow this size.
And we couldn't believe that, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
When tomatoes were beautiful, ripe and red, at night in the morning, about 200 hypersons appeared from the river and ate everything, and we said the guards,``Oh my God, the hypersons! ''
And the guards said, ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I thought we only did the Italian, we made mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what Americans did, what the English did, what the French, what the French, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the Hippo.
They should see the waste -- they should see the waste that we give them people in Africa.
You want to read a book, I read``Hello Death"by Saddam Mayo, shame economist.
The book released in 2009.
We, Western donor countries, have delivered the African continent two million dollars over the last 50 years.
I won't tell you about the damage that money has caused.
Just read their book.
Watch it from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are imperial, colonial missions, , and we treat people only in two ways: or pathogens, or we are patronists.
The two words came from the Latin root, which means``father . ''
But they mean two different things.
Pathing, , I treat any of a different culture as if they were my kids . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
sponsoring, , in a different culture as if they were my servant . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So the targets in Africa are called``Bobblenne ,"boss.
That book gave me a slap in my face ., ., ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This should be the first principle of aid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The first principle of aid is respect.
So this morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said,``Can you -- can you imagine a city that is not neural? ''
And I decided to 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called Facebook Facebook where you have never started anything, you will never start with anybody, but it becomes a servant of the local passion, the servant of local passion who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what does you do? It's quiet.
It's never come to a community with an idea, and it sits with the people of locality.
We don't work from offices.
We got together in a coffee . We put us in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
Most important is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what will you do?
The passion that she has for his own growth is the most important.
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And then we help them find knowledge, because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why don't we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why don't we, for once, we hear them? But not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never go through, and they will never tell you, ,, ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So planning has this blind point.
To the smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't want their public meetings.
What do we do?
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family's family doctor, the family's family doctor, which is established with you in your house, on the table of your kitchen, in the coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a way of living life.
I started this as a test in Spain, West Australia City.
I was doing a in that time, trying to take away from this freezing junk where we to to tell you what to to.
And in one year, I had 27, and in a year, and the government came to me to say,``How can you do that? ''
How can it do it?, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I shut up and I listened ."So, then the government says,``Make it again . ."We in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 business.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs that are dying of loneliness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Peter Dockliss, , one of the most great business advisers in history, passed 60, a few years ago.
Peter Drake was a, before I got involved in business, and this is what Peter Drug says:``planning is actually incompatible with a society and an innovative company . ''
planning is the kiss of death spirit death.
So now you're looking at Christopher without knowing what the most astute in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to conversation with you.
You have to offer confidence, privacy, has to be fantastic when you help them, and then they'll come up on mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What's a presentation of this morning?
That's what you have applaud.
So, what I tell you is that entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the at the at the end of the first industrial rainforest fossil fossil fossil fossil, manufacturing -- and one moment, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The brakes like a way of holding machinery is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we nutrients, we cut, we educate, we transport, we communicate seven billion people in a sustainable way.
There's no technologies to do it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Who is going to invent the technology for green revolution? Climate revolution?
Government? Forget it!
It will be entrepreneurs and they are doing it now.
There's an adorable story that I read in a future magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to debate the future in New York City in 1960.
And in the year 1960, this group of people came together, and they speculate about what would happen to the city of New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was the: New York City would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and they pointed out, if population is getting to grow up to this rate, to bring population in New York City to the surroundings, they will require six million horses, and manure produced for six million horses would be impossible to addressing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They were already in manure . So, in 1960, they were dividing this dirty technology that's going to be in New York life.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1990, in the United States, there was 100 automotive companies , 110.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed and there were very few, statisticians, factories in places.
Death, Michigan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer confidence.
Otherwise, you won't come up with you.
Then, you have to give them an absolute, dedicated, extreme service.
And, subsequently, you will have to tell the truth with respect.
The smallest company, the, the biggest company, has to be able to do three things that you want to do, and the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing, ,, to a great financial administration.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for money just . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There is no.
This is not yet born.
We've been researching and looked at the 100 icon companies from the Carnegie world, Washington, Edison, Ford, all the new companies, Google, . .
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: one person.
The word``me ,"but the``us ,"32 times.
He wasn't just when he started . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Nobody starts a company . No one.
So, we can create the community where we have families, who came from an environment of little business, sitting in coffee, in bars together to their so-called shrimp who are going to do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who speaks to this epic, ,, someone who will ask you, what does it need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, can you sell? Can you look for money? ''
\" Oh, no, I can't do that ."`` Would you want me to look for someone?????????????????????????????????????????????????
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those who surrounded us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all of the neighbors, so we don't exchange much knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like automatic, plants and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their apartments?
How can we afford and ask up more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our our landscape better?? .? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?
How do we share our hopes in empty shops so that our communities can reflect our needs and our dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I'm in love with New Orleans.
My soul always finds relief with giant robots that give shadows, bars and dreamer of centuries and trust.
It always gives music to music, and there's a parade in New Orleans . The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the most abandoned properties in the United States.
I live close to this house, and I thought how it could turn into a more enjoyable space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009 I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was Joan ,.
Her death was sudden and unexpected . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I thought a lot about death.
And this produced a deep gratitude for life time.
It gave clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But I make this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it it's easy to be caught by day and forgetting really important for one.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant blackboard and painted on it to complete,``Before I die, I want . ''
So the transplants could take a chalk, reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect this experiment, but the next day the wall was full and kept covering.
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
\" Before I die, , I want to be judged by piracy ,"`` Before I", I want to sit at the bottom of a date change.
\" Before I die, I want to sing for millions of people . ''
\" Before I die, ,, I want to plant a tree . ''
\" Before I die, ,, I want to live outside of the . ''
\" Before I die, ,, I want to hug it again . ''
\" Before I die, , I want to go to someone's rescue . ''
\" Before I die, ,, I want to be completely myself . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh, they tore me, and they gave me comfort in hard moments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's about knowing that you're not alone . It's about understanding our neighbors in new school and scarcitically, ,, it's about giving the thought of thinking and contemplation, and to remember what's important for us as we grow and change.
This happened last year and started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my civic center colleagues, we did a kit, and they have now done walls in countries from around the world, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
We also show the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of increase in increase, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to preserve perspective and remember that life is short and delicate.
Death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we're going to prepare for death is one of those things that trust us more power.
Think about the clarify death our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what matters to us as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, people who surrounded us cannot only help improve places, to improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce my brothers.
Now, regret is 22, it high and very handsome.
It doesn't talk, , but it even better than some of the best speakers.
Now, I know what love is.
It's sharing it completely happens what happens.
It's not no longer . . . . . . .
It doesn't care about the religious differences and focus on this: . .
When he's singing songs from our childhood, trying to make words that I can't even remember me, I remember one thing: the little thing that we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old . It's very handsome.
It has the most unpredictable memory.
However, it a selective memory.
I don't remember if I my chocolate, ,, , but I remember the year that each one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four, to my arm in my arm during the first episode of Telescope and birthday birthday.
Don't you don't seem incredible?
But most people don't agree.
And, in fact, because their minds don't adjust to the concept of society of society, they are often ignored and uncertainty . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But what I pushed my heart and strength my soul was that even if that was the case, even though I wouldn't consider them within the ordinary, that could only mean one thing: that were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of those fewer familiar with the term``autism ,"is a complex brain disorders affecting social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In every individual, they manifest differently, so it's so different to Sam.
And around the world, every 20 minutes, a new case of autism is diagnosed, and even though it's one of the the disorders of development that faster increases in the world, there's no cure.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized he was different.
It's a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at.
I lived alive and received in his own world, , with his own rules, and I found pleasure on the smallest things, like putting cars in rows around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating anything that was between media.
As it grew up, it became more different, and the differences became more evidence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But beyond the managers, , the frustration and the endless hyperactivity, there was something really unique: : a pure and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without prejudice, a human being I had never lied . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Extraordinary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments where I would have wanted them to be just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they are things that would not want to change for normal.
The normality goes through the beauty that give us the differences, and the fact to be different doesn't mean that some of them is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could convey one thing to Romo and Sam and to you, it would be they don't have to be normal.
They can be remarkable.
Because autistic or no, the differences that we have -- they are a gift! Each of us has a gift in their inside and, honestly, the pursuit of normality is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for greatness, progress and change in the moment where we try to be like others.
Please -- don't tell me that I am normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, , I had a little bit of what must have been to be Alice Asia in wonders.
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher, who gave a a class of engineering students.
It was scared . It was really scared . students with his big minds, his big books and and unknown words . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But when you develop those conversations, I felt what Alice must make sense when I fell through the hole hole and saw a new world.
I just felt like I had these conversations with students . I was surprised the ideas you had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We need desperately a great communication of our scientists and engineers to the end of changing the world . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges, from energy to the environment and care of health, among others, and if we don't understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to seeing their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please humans.
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question to answer: and so what?
Tell us why science is relevant for us.
They don't just tell us that they study the jobs, but they study the jobs, ,, , that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understanding and treating the.
And when you're describing your science, , care with your jargon . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The jargon is an obstacle for our understanding of their ideas . . . . . . . . . .
Sure, you can say``space and temporary ,"but why not``space and time ,"which is much more accessible to us?
And make them accessible to make them silly.
Instead, as Einstein said, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
You can clearly communicate your science without compromise.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies, and they are ways of ladies and enthusiasm with their content.
And when you present your work, forget the signs of``bullet . ''
You've been wondering why you call``bullets ,"what do they do? Banks kill, and kill their presentation.
A film like this is not only boring, but it's too much support in the language of our brain and overwhelmed.
Instead, this example of Gene Brown is much more effective . It shows that the special structure of the forests is so so so strong that really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a simple, legible sentence that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and next, provide graphs that affect our other senses and believe a deeper sense of understanding what's described.
I think these are just some keys that can help us open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, for all the media, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
One of my favorite words from all of the Oxford English Dictionary is``South . ''
Just because it sounds very well.
And``Soviet"means``definitive policy . . ''
Although there was a pediatric editor in the 19th century who defined it much better when he said,``A subset"is the one who is looking for a public burden without matter, platform or principle, and that, when I win, you get it for the, when you win, you get it for a measure of a sense.
I have no idea what``recording . ''
Something about words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis of politics, and that all politicians know you have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't until, for example , 177 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to kill the exact words that were told in parliament camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera . camera
And all of this was thanks to the bravery of a guy with the named Brazil's name from Brazil Crossist, . .
They got into the London Tower and they would lock him up, , but he had the enough courage to deal with them, and at the end, he had such popular support in London.
And just a few years later, we had the first use recorded from the phrase``so Ballae . ''
Most people think it's literal.
It's not . It is a freedom of freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to come back to the United States, right after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a Republican country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country? country . .
This was debate in Congress for a long time.
All sorts of suggestions were introduced that could have frustration . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Some of you wanted to call it``West of State Washington ,"and other, Alternate Washington, , the U.S. people' population . ''
Not very attractive.
Some just wanted to call it``King . ''
They thought it was quality.
And not even with it, they had the idea that you could be picked up King for a certain term.
And there might be serious . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Everybody's felt immensely, because this debate is released for three weeks.
I read the day of a, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What caused the delays, and it was that the Department of Representatives was against the Senate.
The Department Camera didn't want Washington to being drunk of power.
They didn't want to call him King for whether he was giving him or her.
So, they wanted to give the most modest, more insignificant title that came to them.
And that title was``President . ''
They didn't invent the title . It was already before, but it just meant``somebody who has a meeting . ''
It was like the president of a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And it didn't have much more gravity than the term``capital"or``superstar . ''
There were experimental presidents of little colonial developments and government failures, ,, ,, ,.
And so the Senate is operating.
They said,``It's ridiculous, , we can't call it President . ''
\" This guy has to be treated and reunited with foreign dignity . ''
\" And who would take it seriously with such a ridiculous and influenced title like President of America? ''
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate did not.
We can learn three interesting things about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to find out, the Senate has never responded to the President's title.
President Barack Obama is lucky to staying there, Star in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is temporary -- -- that we keep waiting for 22 more years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and I want to leave you with this, is that the title of President in the United States doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of an aerial vehicle vehicle and so on . .
The reality and history have led to the title of gravity.
So at the end of the Senate.
They got their television title . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of uniqueness -- good, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But, you know how many nations have you now president?
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc.
So, at the end, the won in the the, the won, and the House of Representatives lost, because no one is going to feel humble when they tell you that they're now the U.S. President.
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and I'd like to leave you.
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape shape and control reality, but actually, the moral reality much more than the words that they could change reality.
Thank you.
I'm 45 to feet underground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard breathing.
I feel the rock of the sweaty body in the dark, , but I.
I hear voices that they talk about, but mostly, that male cough and stones with primitive tools.
Like each other, ,, I carry a decent light of concrete light to the head with this orange electronics, and I can barely distinguish branches that are holding the walls of a meter falling hundreds of meters on the ground.
I slipped my hand and suddenly remember a miner that I met days before, that lost control and fell countless meters in that piece.
While I talk to you today, these men are deep in the deep of that hole, their lives without paying or reward and, often dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they might never do, because they are the president of slavery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the last 28 years, ,, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only exhibition in the Vancouver Peace.
In between all the incredible people I met there I met there to an integral of Fred the keys, an NGO that is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery, and really, I started learning about slavery, because I knew it exists in the world, but not that degree.
When we ended up talking, I felt very bad; I was honest to ignore this atrocities of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I was made a knot, and, weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the Denield director and offer it my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these sites.
Some, even, considered my second home.
But this time, it window the dirty suits.
A conservative calculation says that there is over 27 million people enslaved in the world.
It's twice the amount of Africans displaced during all the traditional slave.
150 years ago the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars.
However, today you can climb up entire families by generations for $18.
Surprisingly, slavery generates profits from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled with false amounts of good education and better work to find out that they are forced to work without paying, under threat and can't escape.
Today slavery operates in trade: goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable.
slavery exists at all the world, yet, illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I I met brick furnaces.
This strange and bizarre show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the in the hell of DNA . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
immersed in a temperature of 54 degrees, men, women, children, in fact, entire families wrapped into a, of mechanically bricks in their head, ,, ,, ,, and bring them out of the blazing furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of meters . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
From the monkey and tiredness work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 hours a day.
There were no countries to eating, , to drink, and the severe destineer made that pee was pretty intriguing.
They were so peculiar and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to revive it and, sit there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
And back in the oven, I wanted to cry, but the governor who was at my side quickly grabbed me and said,``Lisa, don't do it . Don't do it here . ''
And I really clearly explained to prove emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help . . .
I couldn't give you money, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I wasn't a citizen of that country.
I could put them into a.
I had to trust in Fred the and and and work within the system for his release and trust it to get it.
As much as I, , wait to get home to feel my favorite heart.
In the Himalayas, I found kids running rocks for miles for miles, to trucks that were waiting down.
Those large plans were heavier than children who charge them and children are going to take them their heads with loads and made of sticks, ropes and rags.
It's hard to something so overwhelming.
How can we influence something so insidious, but so ubiquitous?
Some of you don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 17 hours a day without paying because this has been so long.
They have nothing to compare to.
When these villages turned out their freedom, the slavery struggled in their homes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
When we hear slavery, we often think about sexual traffic, and because of this global awareness, ,, I warned that it would be hard to work safely in this particular business.
In Khatanga, I women who had been previously sexual slaves.
They drove me through an atomic stairs that gave this dirty basement, of a fluorescent light.
It was not a brothel.
It was rather a restaurant.
Resorted, as you know in the office, are local for forced prostitution.
They have small, private rooms, where the slaves with their girls and children, some of the only seven years are forced to train customers and encourage them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each point is dark and dirty, identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a biological and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to hands of their customers.
As a foot in the, I remember a sense acute fear, and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be to be stuck in that hell.
I just had a leap: , where it came into.
There were no dogs.
There was no window enough to big enough.
Those people don't have creepy and, since we play a theme so hard, ,, , it's important to slavery, even sexual traffic, happens around us.
There are hundreds of scale people in agriculture, in restaurants, in domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 thousand American children are sold every year as sex slaves . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's going on by the, but we don't.
The textiles are another activity that we often relate to the labor of labor.
I visited Indian villages in which there were entirely classified families in the silk trade . .
This is a family portrait.
The single black hands are the father, the sorts of blue and red, of their children.
They mix sharks in these big barrels and dip silk in liquid, but the ink is toxic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
My intellect told me his stories . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
\" We have no freedom ,"they said.
We still hope, however, to be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our work . ''
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 scaled children in the Volta lake, the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we came up, , I.
I saw what seemed to be a family family in a ship, two older boys, some younger kids, ,, isn't it? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Wrong . They were all slaves . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Kids are separated from their transferred families, disappeared and forced to work extractions in these boats in the lake, , despite not knowing swimming.
This kid's eight.
When our boat came up, he was shaking, , little canoe was pregnant.
I was paralyzed by fear of falling water.
The branches of the trees of the trees in the Volvo lake often catch networks and children, ,, ,, to the water to unleash the branches.
Many are drowning.
Ever since I remember, has always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love, it's not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruel, cruised treat the younger slaves under his command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they got up the last networks, but they had been working from one.
In the cold and windy night.
And he's able to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they are full of fish . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I want to introduce you to Kofi.
Kofi was rescued in a.
I met it in a shelter where the keys is released to slavery victims.
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who will be because someone decided to make the difference in their life?
It's driving by a road in Ghana with partners from Fred, and a abuse companion with his smartphone suddenly accepted and shaped our car and played the window.
We asked us to on a land of land to the jungle . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At the end of the way, we were inspired to coming out of the, and asked the driver to go out quickly . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And then he pointed out this very visible summer and said,``This is the way, this is the . Come on . ''
As we started down down, we removed the animals that blocked the way, and after walking close to an hour we found out that the way we've been stuck in the world's recent rains, so I put the pictures of on my head as we went off in these waters to the chest . . .
After two hours of walk, the nice way ended up in a clear, and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit in a, , and they were all filled with slavery workers . .
Many women had children attached to their backs and, while they were looking for gold, they walked in water poisoned water.
The market is used in the extraction process.
These minerals are enslaved in a piece of Ghana.
When they came out of the wells they were pregnant in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, ,, ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The wells have up to 90 meters, and these people are carrying heavy bags of stones that then will be transported to another area where they would make the stone to pull the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong and aggressive men, but, if we look closer, we see the to work to other less lucky and also kids.
All victims of injuries, diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this muscle ends up like this victims of tuberculosis and poisoning per for a few years.
This is manufacturing . When his father died his uncle took it to him in mines.
When you die his uncle, Mumbai inherit the debt that forces it to be slave in mines.
When I met it, I had worked in the ages of 14 years and the lesion of the leg you see here is a product of an accident in the mine, so serious that doctors said it should be amputation.
In addition to that, , Manuel has tuberculosis, and then, it's obliged to working night and day in that mine.
Still, he dream to be released and educated with help of local activists like Freedom, and it's this kind of determination, to a remote possibility, which inspires me much respect.
I want to throw light on slavery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They knew that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to you knew that we're going to take testimony from them and we will do everything possible to help change their lives.
I honestly believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very hard to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not of magazines ., ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , dignity and respect.
There's no day that happens that I don't think about these so many beautiful, bad people, that I've had the great honor to meet . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I hope that these images are going to wake up a force in which you see them, in people like you, and I hope that that force includes a fire, and that fire survey light on slavery, because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in shadows.
Thank you.
I do math math, and there's a peculiar problem for anyone, we're like management consumers.
Nobody knows what we do.
So today, I'm going to try and explain what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We're going to slow up the virtuous of the ballet and the dance dancers that we'll see later.
But the ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training, , a high level of skill and probably some initial attitude that can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders as the evil of Parkinsons destroyed gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend John Strandlet who, in his time, was a virtual ballet dancer.
In the last few years, a lot has been moved in treatment.
However, there are 3.2 million people in the world that are sick and they are sick, and they have to deal with an incurable weakness, tremor, stiffness and other symptoms, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in objective ways and, in definition, the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective and certain metric.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson and other disorders of movement there are no biological markers, so they don't serve blood analysis and the best we have is a 201 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it . ., , and that's never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
That would save a defining journey to the clinic . What if patients could do the test themselves?
It wouldn't need personal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
By the way, it costs a few dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to do is, what I want to propose to you as no conventional form to try, you see, in a sense at least, we're all virtuous like my friend John Strandlets.
This is a video of the vibration of vocal strings.
It shows somebody healthy as it gets sounds to talk . We can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet, because we have to coordinate all those of those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the necessary genes . Fortunation, for example.
And like the ballet, it requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about the time that brings a child to learn to talk.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal strings as they vibrate, and as the Parkinsons affects limbs, it also affects vocal organs.
At the bottom of the, you can see an example of irregular transportation from vocal strings.
We see the same symptoms.
vocal, debilitating and stiffness.
The speech becomes more quiet and apart after a, ,, . . . . . . . . . .
How do they compare these tests based on voice with specialized clinical trials? Well, both are not invasive.
The neurological test is not invasive . Both use existing infrastructure.
It's not necessary to design a whole series of hospitals to do it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Both of them are accurate . Okay, ,, , they are not specialized.
I mean, they can be administrators.
They are done very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as much.
They're a minimum cost and we all know what happens.
When something takes up a cost so low, it a mass scale.
These are some incredible goals to address.
We can reduce the logistical difficulties of patients.
I wouldn't have to go to the to the clinic for routine check.
With high-speed monitoring we could get objective data.
We could do massive recovering cost for clinical trials to clinical trials and for the first time, factors of general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first birthday bombings before it's too late . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So when you give today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Pacific Initiative of Parkinsons.
Together to aquaculture and Paterons, , and Paterons, we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have accessible local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
Anybody, with or without Parkinsons, can call it low price and leave a, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , just eight hours.
Thank you . Tom Rielly: So Max, taking all these samples from, say 10,000 people, will you say who's healthy and who?
What would you get from these samples?
Max Littman: : Yeah . What happens is that during the call, you have to indicate if you have or not the disease . TR: Of course.
PM: , you see, some people can don't . It may not.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data collected in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for light factors in looking for the actual markers of disease . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
TR: You have 86 percent accuracy right now?
PM: much more than that . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Actually, my student Thailands, I, ,, ,, has done a fantastic job, and it has now shown that it works in the cell phone network as well, what it strikes the project . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
TR: Ninety and nine . . .
PM: of.
TR: Thank you . Max Littman, audience . .
PM: Thank you, Tom.
Before March , 2011, I made photographs in New York City.
We're happy, gray creatures.
We're hiding in the dark, in rooms without windows and, usually, we avoid sunlight.
We make the models even more thin, the perfect skin, the even more perfect, we do the impossible, possible skin, and they criticize us in press all the time, but some of us are really talented with a lot of years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11 , 2011, , I saw from my home, , the tragic events that are going on in Japan.
Shortly time later, an organization where it was volunteer, Hollywood, it was in place, working as part of the answer team.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers, we knew that we couldn't be sitting in home, ,, , so I.
The 13 of May traveled to the.
It's a, which is a little bit of fishermen that are located in the interview of 50 thousand people, one of the first towns affected by waves . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The level of recorded water reached over 24 feet, and over three kilometers land inside . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As you can imagine, the people were devastated . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We put them out of channels and boxes.
We cleaned up schools . We removed the mud and we left the houses ready to be renewed and rebuilding.
We're taking tons and tons of dead fish, appropriate fish, computer factory.
We were excited, and we loved.
Over weeks, both the volunteers as the neighbors found similar things . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They found pictures and pictures of pictures and cameras and sandwich.
They all did the same.
Pick them up and bring them to different places of around to to keep them out.
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had suffered.
As they came from the waves, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started helping help in a center of the village.
He helped clean the common bathrooms, giant barriers.
This place turned out to be also the place of the people where the evidence center collected the photos.
And they took them, and I had the honor that that day would trust me to wipe up the pictures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression to think beyond the horizon, but it wasn't until I was to transplant myself my horizons that something happened.
When you look at pictures, I found some who were over a hundred years old, some were in the lab on the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking as a, how to fix that trait and repair that back and knew hundreds of people who could do the same . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So that night entered Facebook, I had some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive, that I knew we had to try it.
So we started picking the pictures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too wrong, but where the water had declared the face of the girl, he had a lot of precision and deliberation.
Otherwise, that little girl wouldn't have the aspects of herself, and that would be as tragic as to have the the.
By the time, they came to luck more pictures, and they needed more feedback, so I entered Facebook and LinkedIn and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
At two weeks, I had 150 people coming together.
In Japan, in July, we moved to Lebruge, a neighboring town in North Carolina . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Once a week we used our scanner in the temporal photographic libraries that had been installed, where people were going to reclaim their pictures.
The time they took to throw it out is a different story, depends on the waste of the photos.
I could say an hour . I could make weeks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I could say months.
This kid had to protected virtually by hand using the areas whose color and detail the water had not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures in seawater, covered from bacteria, with algae, even with oil oil oil, all of that together with the pace of the continued time by destroying them, so cleaning them by hand was an important part of the project . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We couldn't pick up the picture unless it was clean, , dry and had been replaced by his owner.
We were lucky with cleanliness.
We count the guide of an admired neighbor . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's very easy to even more harmful pictures . . .
As you once said once Windows, my group's leader is like doing a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes . . .
The woman that brought us these pictures in relation to the photos.
I had started cleaning it herself, ,, ,, , even more.
I also had doubled . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Without them, the images of their husband and of their own face wouldn't have been able to rebuild, we were able to flap the images in one picture and pick up the whole picture.
When I picked his pictures, he shared something of his story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble, so far from where his house used to be, , acknowledged.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the the the to close the barriers to waves.
He had to go inside of the water while the Sirens sounded.
Her young sons, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , ,.
One of them was caught in water.
He took a week to find his whole family and know that everyone had survived.
The day that I put his pictures up his youngest son 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could do, something that he could go back to look, something that could remember from the past that would not have been marked by that March day when everything in her life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up with hundreds of them, hundreds of them helped us wipe up more than 120,000 photographs, the great majority, the most returned to their owners.
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us return to 90 hundreds of totally respected and respected pictures . . .
During this time, we really don't spend more than a in teams and materials, most of ink for printers.
We take pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a place, a relationship, someone dear.
They are a guard of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take, but the first thing we'll get back to.
It was about this project, to restore small pieces of humanity, ,, to give someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this goes back to someone, ,, it a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of revolutions.
Some of them connected them to something larger, to give back something, ,, , using their talent for something that are not perfect skin models.
To end me, I'd like to read this email, I sent him Cindy the day I went back from Japan after six months.
While I was playing, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories to show in images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the young girls, ,, ,, ,, , because a single picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, me and my newborn daughter, hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
Doc Engelbart inspired us to awe and curious with this picture of a a block in an exhibition of only a million second.
But now , 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion or a billion frames per second.
So I present you a new kind of photograph: the metaphorically, a new technique that you can create video video videos in motion.
And that we can create cameras that you can see after the corners, beyond the vision line, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and defy the idea of camera . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So if I take a laser pointer and put it up and off in a second, in a second, in several camps, you will create a picture of a millimeter wide.
And that pictures of photons, that bullet, travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet.
So if we take that ball and this picture package and shoot on this bottle, how do those pictures spread inside this bottle? . . . . . . . . . . .
What is the aspects of light in slow motion?
Now, all of this -- remember all of this is happening effectively in less than a nanotuc one, is what it takes to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola doesn't apply this research . There's a lot of things in this film, to to this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our bullet, comes into the bottle with a, and that, within, it starts to spread.
Part of the light goes on, ,, ,, ,, , and we started seeing these disorders . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Many of the photons finally come to the top and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounce in the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several frames, that thoughts concentrate.
Now, if we take a common and current, and we make it go back the same distance, and we see it in a slow camera to about 10 billion times, how much think we would take us back to see that film?
One day? A week? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It would be a very boring film of a.
And what about dead nature?
You can see the waves that are going on from the table, the tomato and from the bottom.
It's like dragging a stone on a pond.
It's the the way nature paints a picture, I thought, from a memory at once, but of course, our eyes see an integral composition.
But if you look at this tomato, you'll realize that, as light would be stripped out of tomato, it's still brilliant . It doesn't get dark . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Why? Because the tomato is mature and the light light in its inner and back and then several billions of second.
In the future, when this campaign is in your phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is mature without having to touch it.
So what do this camera at MIT?
As a photographer, you know, if we take a picture of low exposure, it comes into very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition, so you just get some light.
We send that balance, , that pictures, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very authoritarian sync, , data, and we set them computer, and we to computer to create those of those that I showed you . . . . . .
We can take all of that data in raw and process it interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What if a new power of a superhero future would allow him to see after corners?
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door, registor, go into the room, a part will reflect on the door, and from the to the camera.
We could extract those multiple light robots.
It's not science fiction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On the left, it's our our.
Behind the wall there is a blanket and we will break light on the door.
So after the publication of our article in nature Communication.
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to camera, but interestingly, in a slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our, our campaign has unique capacities.
It has very good temporary resolution and can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we do we do we do, but we don't know what extent to how much distance.
By projecting a laser, you can record a picture, that you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we will bring them and try to analyze the multiple light robots, and that we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it 3D?
This is our rebuilding.
We have things to explore before we take this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions with what is around the curve . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Or we could seek survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build up applies able to see the inside of the body, service, and same for cardives.
But of course, because of tissue and blood, this is pretty hard, so actually this is a question to scientists so that you start thinking about metaphorical as a new visualization of visualization to solving the problems of image imaging in the next generation.
So like Doc Engelbart, he himself a scientist, converted science in art, an art of undergraduate photographs.
I realized that all of the gigabytes of data that we collected each time is not just for scientific visualization, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It will create a new form of computing photography with slow camera and color code.
And we look at those waves . Remember, time between each of those waves is just a few seconds of second.
But here's a funny thing.
If you look at the waves under the top, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we're recording almost the speed of light, we have strange effects . Einstein would have love to see this image.
The order of the events in the world sometimes appears to invest in camera.
applying the corresponding deforestation of space and time, we can correct this distortion.
It's time . Thanks.
Hi . .
A cell phone can change life, and it gives you individual freedom . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A cell phone can photograph a crime against humanity in Syria.
So with a cell phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
So with a cell phone, you can record a song, rise to South and make it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a 1840s, and I live in Berlin City.
Let's go back to this moment, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were tested in search for change.
This is the the fall in 1989 . Imagine if all these people gathered to protest in search for a change, they had a mobile in the pocket.
Who's a cell phone here?
Get it out.
Raise your mobile phones.
Avoid it . An Android, a Blackberry, ,, ., ., ., . ., . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's much . Almost all of you today have a cell phone.
But today to talk about me, my cell phone, and how I changed life.
Talk about this.
These are 35 830 lines of information . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Data data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, Commission . I presented an address . . .
Data Research Director.
This addresses says that every European phone company, , every single Internet provider, has to store a wide range of information from users . .
Who calls who . Who sends an email to who.
Who sends him to who.
And if we use the phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and two years in your phone company or your Internet provider.
And all over Europe, people were planted and said,``We don't want this . ''
They said they didn't want this data feedback.
We want the self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone and the Internet to store all this information on us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And here you can see about ten thousand people who went out to the streets of Berlin and said,``Freedom, I don't fear . ''
And some even said that this would be the State 2.0.
The statue was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this works really.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use mobile?
So I asked my phone, Defense Telescope, ,, ,, , was the largest telephone company in Germany, who please sent me all the information that they had about me . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I asked them once, and I asked them to, and I didn't get a concrete answer . It was all blah blah blah blah.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you're proposing my life.
So I decided to bring a legal demand because I wanted to have this information.
But Defense Telescope said no, we won't give this information.
At the end, we signed an agreement.
I would remove the demand, and they sent me the information I asked.
Meanwhile, the German constitutional tribunal failed for the unconscious law of the E.U .'s.
So I got this ugly ones on brown with a inside . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And at CDs, there was this.
Thirty and five thousand acres of information lines.
At the beginning I saw them, and I said, well, it's an enormous file . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It was a little skeptical: what should you do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the data returns.
So next to Keith Danone and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a six-year-old visualization.
You can zoom back and go back and forwards.
You can see every step I give.
And you can see how I go from Franklin in train to colony, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is all possible with this information.
That gives you a little scary.
But not just about me.
But from all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk a couple times.
Then they call me some friends, and they call each other.
And then you call each other, and the other one to another, and we end up with this great network of communications.
You can see how their people communicate between what time they call each other, which hour sleep.
You can see all of this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who you talk to who, who sent an email to who, ,, ,, access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin in 1989, they had a cell phone in the pocket.
And the State would have known who participated in this protest, and, if the State had known who leaders were, this would never have happened.
The Berlin Wall maybe never happened.
And, in a result, also not the Earth Court.
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible inside and outside of the . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and want to store them forever.
But self-determination and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for self-determination.
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go home to home tell their friends that privacy is a 21st century value, and it's not fashion.
When you go home, tell your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, you don't have to do it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your phones that you're serving to remember that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, ,? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, ,? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I call me Massie Zewelon, and I am not drunk, but I know the doctor that brought me into the world . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I cut my mom six times in six different directions, in the process of me.
As a result, I brain palsy, that's why I'm going to have a while.
Look.
It's exhausting . I.
And Muhammad Al.
A C. . .'s not genetic.
It's not no congestion.
No one made the the uterus of my mother and not, because my parents were prime cousins, even though they are.
It just happens for accidents, , like the that happened to me.
Now, I warn you, I, I'm not a source of inspiration.
It feels bad for me, because at some of life, they've wanted to be being disabled.
Let's go from countries.
Christmas workers, they're in the mall, they're in the in the mall, they drive in circles in search for parking and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled . . . . .
And they think,``God, can I be at least a little disabled? ''
Also, I say, I have 99 problems, and.
There's a smell of oppression, I would win the gold medal.
I'm Palestinian, Muslim, woman, disabled and living in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you should do it.
I'm from Parkinson Clinical Park, New Jersey . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same principles.
I also love that if I wanted to walk my home to New York, I could.
A lot of people with brain palsy don't walk, but my parents don't believe in the``can't . ''
The mantra of my father was,``You can do it ."] dancing . ''
If my three older sisters cleaned, I.
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents demand the school system, and they made sure that I was also, and if we didn't take all of the maximum note, we all get my mother's shoes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
My father taught me to walk at five years by putting my talents on his feet and just walking.
Another tactic I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that it would.
The therapist that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah . The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten, like a boxing champion that has received many hits.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabs, , and it's still all of the family . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This was before 9/11 and that politicians would think appropriate to use``hatred Muslims ,"as a campaign motto.
The people I grew up with had no problem with my faith.
However, it seemed to worry a lot about hunger during the Ramadan.
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months with no eating, so I'll help the dawn to the landing is very easy.
I dance in Broadway.
Yeah, in Broadway . It's crazy ., so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with heels, or I can walk with heels.
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be to be a kid, so if my friends were using heels, I also did.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation on the Jerusalem coast, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents feared that if we don't go back to Palestine all summer, we would become Madonna.
In summer vacation often my father was trying to heal me, so I drink milk, so I, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, and I remember the water, and I remember,``works, it works! ''
But the miracle cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before doing yoga, it was a stand-up comedian that couldn't stand up.
And now I can stand in your head.
My parents reinforced this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, ,, and my dream was to be in General Hospital TV.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship for the, University of the state of Arizona, because it was in all of the courses.
It was like the machine department of theater department.
Everybody loved me.
I did all the the tasks of the least intelligent, I took my maximum note in my classes, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene of the crystal my teachers, my teachers were crying.
But it never gets a paper . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Finally, in my last year, the decided to make a work called Banda very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with brain palsy.
I was a girl with brain palsy.
So I started screaming the four winds,``Well, I would have a role!
I have brain palsy.
At the end! At the end!
Thanks to God totally, I'm free . ''
Don't get the paper . They gave it to Shakespeare Brown.
I went to increase the director of the theater department, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to wondering why, and she told me that they believed that they couldn't do the risk stunts.
And I said,``Excuse me, if I can't do the risk stunts, I can't do the character . ''
It was a, and they gave it to an actor without brain palsy.
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a little story of hearing actors without disability for disabled papers.
When I graduated, , I went home, and my first actor tour was like extra on a television.
My dream became reality.
And I knew it would be accelerated from``companion"to``better crazy friend ,"in a sacred.
Instead, I was there like a, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , and it was obvious to me that the reports of the reports didn't hire, not white, with disability.
They just hired people perfect.
But there were exceptions to rule.
I grew up looking at Whole Goldberg, Rose Barry, Ellen, and all these women had one thing in common: they were comedy.
That's why I became hungry.
In my first tour, I took famous New York to New Jersey, and never forget the face of the first cartoon that he took when he fell in mind that he was going to high speed by the New Jersey highway with a that had brain palsy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I worked on clubs from the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and without veil.
Some people say that I am the first monkey of Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I don't know that they never heard that little nasty buzz that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean Orkun, and I launched the Nobel York Commission in New York City, now in her 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of Americans in communication media, and to remind the directors of reports that South and Arabs are not synonymous.
To integrate Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of disability of disability.
My great opportunity reached 2010.
I was like to invite the news program for cable news.
I walked into a graduate dance, they drag me to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the, and I said,``Excuse me, can you give me another chair? ''
She looked at me and said,``Five, four, three, two . ''
And we were live.
So I was clinging to the desk's desk to don't get out of the screen over the screen during the segment, and when I finished the interviews, I.
I had my opportunity at the end of my opportunity, and unfortunately, I knew they didn't go back.
But not only Mr. Oliver came back to invite me, but I was a full-time particular time and pasted my chair.
Something funny that I learned in direct with Keith Olympics was that people on the Internet are scum.
It's said that kids are cruel, ,, ,, but they never get out of me or a little girl.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became an object.
I look at online clips with comments like,``Why do you shake? ''
\" Is it alien? ''
And my favorite,``Poor Bubble.
What disease does it have?.
We should really pray for it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A comment suggested even that I would add my disability to my rsum: ,, ,, paralyzed.
The disability is as visual as race.
If someone in wheels can't make Beijing, ,, ,, , they can't make someone in wheelchair . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The disabled ones are -- yeah, clap, man . Come on.
The disabled minority is the the largest minority in the world, and the most spread in the entertainment world.
The doctors said not to walk, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown with the media, I don't think it was.
I hope we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, , less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all society to teach our children well.
My torso journey has led me to very spectacular places . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I came to walk through the red red carpet by the development of the Tusmain Luck and Close Arbers.
I came to a film with Adam Sandel and working with my idol, the incredible Dave Matthew.
I went through the world,``The Arabs have become crazy . ''
I was delegate in the great state of New Jersey in 2008.
And I founded``The Children of Massage ,"a charity organization to give kids Palestinian refugees a number of what my parents gave me.
It was the only my father saw me act alive, and I this talk to her memory.
\" down peace, Dad . ''
I call me Massive Zeyboor, and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell a story about a child of a small village.
I don't know his name, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He lives in a little village in South Somalia.
This village is near Mogadishu.
The drought takes the little village to poverty and the edge of the innovation.
Nothing for him there, goes to the great city, in this case, Mozart, the Saucerbalu capital.
When it comes there, there is no, there's no, there's no work, no future perspectives.
He ended up living in a tent in the outside of Mogadishu.
After maybe a struggle, nothing.
One day, a gentleman is about to bring him to lunch, after dinner, to breakfast.
He knows a dynamic group of people who gives him a speech.
It gets a little money for you to buy new clothes, money to send home, your family.
They introduce a young man.
It's finally married.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in Mogadishu, under a ,.
That little child with the dreams of the great care was the suicide terrorist, , and that dynamic group of people were to the Sharian, a terrorist organization connected to Qaeda.
So how does a story of a a little town trying to fulfilling their dreams in the cities end up with him????????????????????????????????????????????????
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start your future, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This was the first that I pulled out of what we call``hope period . ''
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world . . . . . . . .
It's the history of, the young urban young urban people who are missing riots in Johannesburg, they're looking for riots in London, which look for something beyond the hope period.
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the of the opportunity, of jobs, of well-being, but young people don't participate in their cities.
It's often the youth that has the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people living in cities will be less than 18.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them any opportunity, the history of waiting period, the access door, to violence, to pandemics, will be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown, Mogadishu, , 70 percent of young people are unemployed.
Seventy percent doesn't work, to school.
They don't do virtually anything . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I went back to Mogadishu last month, , and I went to visit the Middle hospital, the hospital where I was born.
I remember to be at that terrified hospital, thinking, , ,? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What if I had forced to be in that same``hope period"?
Would I have become terrorists?
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was at Mogadishu that month was actually to to deal with juvenile leaders in a corporate summit.
It gathered about 90 Somali juvenile leaders . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We sat and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the great challenges that the city is facing.
One of the young people in the room was Adam . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He went to University University, graduated.
There was no jobs, or opportunity.
I remember when he told me, that because it was a graduate, unemployed university, , was the the perfect white for Al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations to being recruited.
They were seeking people like him.
But this story takes a different way.
In Mogadishu, to get from the point A to B, they are streets.
Six years of civil war have completely destroyed the viable system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest to mobilize.
And they saw an opportunity and it took it.
It started a . .
It started anticipating motorcycles to local residents who usually couldn't afford them . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I bought 10 motors, , with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at at at at next three years.
Why is this story different?
What makes this story different?
I think his ability to identify and leverage a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's the entrepreneurial spirit, and I think the entrepreneurial spirit can be the most powerful tool against the``hope period . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's easier to young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking so desperately.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Moorer Mozart, a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I was helping me train some of the young people in the business initiative, and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of corporate initiative.
In fact, it's the first flower that Mogadishu has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Muhammad came up, if you wanted flowers to your wedding, you were in plastic, you were in plastic sent from overseas.
If you ask somebody,``When was it the last time you see fresh flowers? ''
For those who grew up during civil war, the answer would be,``Never . ''
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a and design company.
I created a in the outskirts of Mogadishu, and began to grow up cultures and tears, which he said, could survive the doughness of Mogadishu.
And it started the delivery flowers for wedding, ,, creating gardens in houses, and companies in the city, and it's now working on creating the first public park park of Mogadishu in 22 years.
There aren't public parks in Mogadishu . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It wants to create a, young people can go together, and as he says, smell the proverbial rose.
By the way, he does not grow pink, because they use a lot water.
So the first step is inspired young people, and in that room, the presence of Muhammad had a really profound impact in young people.
They had never thought about starting a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They had thought about working for an NGO, , working for government, but their story, their innovation really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to looking at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to you could be entrepreneurs, that you might be to change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the most challenging challenges.
They devised business solutions for local problems . . .
So, inspired young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas really . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They need experience and orientation to guide them in development and put it in their business.
They connect young people with the resources that they need, the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create catalyst for urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I think it's selling hope.
Its Peace Park, that's how it called it, ,, ,, , people see their city.
They're going to the streets of the street to help rent out and keep the, for him.
He gave them a chance to the responsibility of the``hope period . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
These young entrepreneurs are having tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is: they convert young people in entrepreneurs, they include and they feed their inherent innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and parks of the peace and``hope periods . ''
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to camping with my dad in the Arabic mountains, an agricultural area north of New York State.
It was one day.
The forest forest.
The sun would make the leaves shining as a virtual, and not to the the the the, we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to weigh that land.
We came to our.
It was a a beautiful crystal lake when I discovered something horrible . .
Behind the shed, there was a garbage, from about four square meters with apples of apples that were rotten police balls, and old warming, . .
And I was announced, and incredibly confused.
Are the campaigns that were too lazy to taking what they had brought, who thought that it was going to clean their trash?
That question followed with me, and it would be simple.
Who cleans our trash?
No matter how they organized or where they say``our ,"who clean our trash in Istanbul?
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or London?
Here in New York, the Department of Health clean our trash, in terms of 11,000 tons of waste and 2,000 tons of recyclable product every day.
I wanted to know you as individuals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and bring that charge?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his trajectories and interviewed people in offices and installation in the all across the city, ,, ,, , . .
He needed to get more.
So I started working as a garbage collector.
Now not just traveling on trucks . I drove them.
And I operated the mechanics and the bar the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as predictable as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong, you will be used quickly.
It costs a lot to use weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies still keep being adjusted at the weight of to take over their body tons every week.
It's also the danger . . . . . . .
According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, waste collection is one of the 10 most dangerous occupation in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and in the traffic all day, and they pass around you.
They just want to go on, so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for work.
And also the junk itself is full of dangers that are often falling out of the truck and causes terrible damage.
I also learned about the unpressing of garbage.
When you get out of the tape and you see a city from the back of the truck, you can understand that trash is like a force of nature itself.
I never stop coming.
It's also a way of breathing or circulation.
It should always be in motion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And there's also stigma.
It seems to me that the stigma is especially ironic because I believe that waste readers are the most important work in the streets in the city, for three reasons.
They are the first public health producers.
If you don't get rid of the waste in efficient and effective ways every day, this starts to be to download their connections and their inherent dangers threatened us in very real ways . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Disease that we had controlled for decades and centuries turn back and start giving us.
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old, we don't have space for what the economics engines begin to fail when it's in danger the consumption.
I'm not advocating by capitalism, just its relationship.
And then there's what I our average daily speed.
And with it, I'm simply talking about the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't worry about, we don't repair, clean or take us our coffee cup, our battery bag, our water bottle.
We use them, we throw them, we we forget about them, because we know that there's a work force on the other side that will be made of it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce stigma and include it in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Your work, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They're on the street every day, . .
Use a uniform in many cities.
You know when to expect them.
And their work allows us to do ours.
It's almost a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The flow that keeps us left from ourselves from ourselves, of our own waste, our designers, and that flow always needs to stay in one shape or another . . .
One day after September 11 , 2001, I listened to a group harvesting truck on the street, grabbed my little son and went down the stairs running up, and there was a man doing his role of paper recycled as he did all Wednesday.
And I tried to thank him to do his work that particular day, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And he looked at me, and he just nodded, and he said,``Let's be fine.
Let's be good . ''
Shortly after that, I started researching waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called Paul, ,, , we worked together, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that Paul was right.
We're going to be good . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But in our efforts to reshape the way we exist on this planet as a species, we have to include and to account all the costs, even the very real human cost.
The municipal waste, what we think when we talk about trash, represent three percent of the amount of waste of nation.
It's a remarkable statistics . .
So in the flow of your days and of your lives, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, it takes a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Take a moment to tell you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from local conditions and traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like examples.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, in Ethiopia and one in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several floors in Ethiopia's capital, Abed . . . . . . .
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was,``I want to leave running . ''
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to perform.
So in principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to to use a lot of energy because the crystals are generating heat in the inside, so it needs a lot of cooling.
In a city where this should not happen because it's a that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the year.
And third, it has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a pity being so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit Ethiopia, it was really caused with the ancient market that is this structure of the, ,, ,, ,, ,, , and they buy things every day to little marketers.
There's also that idea of using public space to generate outside activity . . activity . .
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a, from several floors, applying these principles.
The next challenge was introduced by inspiring the site, which is located in an area of a lot of the city, where much of the buildings that we see now in the image, they didn't exist.
And there's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in a hundred meters extension.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, put together all the entries of the building.
And this extends with an awkward atrium that creates an outdoor space space in the building that is self-organized, ,, the rain and the rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with little business, which changes in every floor because of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that responds to local climate conditions.
And I went to think of a similar tissue to an ant shell, to allow the input of the air, and also the light, but in a filter way.
We then inspired ourselves in these beautiful buttons of the tubes.
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model the facade.
We're building that with these little fabulous pieces that are the windows that are leaving the air and light in a controlled way inside the building.
This is created with these little crystals of colors that use light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
Now, with these ideas, it didn't really convince developers, because they thought,``That's not a mall . It wasn't what we asked . ''
But in definition, we realized that this market idea was much more profitable than the shopping center because in fact there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic, not only because of the material in comparison with glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have conditioning air.
So we get some savings savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
And the first thing was to think about how to achieve energy expectancy for building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a great advantage by putting photosynthesis on the roof.
And then under those, we think of the roof as a new public space with gathering and bars that create this urban oasis.
And these patches on the roof, which in conjunction collect water for the in the.
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we are the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in Tunisia City.
And to do a project that big, ,, the biggest one I've designed, needed not only to understanding the city of Tunisia, ,, , its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the medina, a thousand years of an antibody that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen access door, connected by almost straight lines . access . .
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand existing streets, create 12 identical blocks in size and features that there is in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relationship with the idea of the right lines, and it modified the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, , the small cell of the project, as the apartment, an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best for an apartment in the Mediterranean climate?
And it's North, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we put a scheme to ensure that most apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city . . . .
It has these blocks with courtyards, and then on the low, we have all the connections for pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that make greater density in higher levels and a lower density on the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of door.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost how to retrieve the community that is occupied by construction . .
It's where all of the neighbors, can go up and socializing, and make activities like running a two kilometers in the morning, or jumping out of a building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process . . . .
And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same pace that buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple, affordable solutions that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and they have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you.
When I was eight, a new girl entered our class . It was so remarkable, as you see all the.
I had large amounts of very brilliant hair and a, , cute, ,, ,, ,, , ,.
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I brought my sinister plan.
I was a day after the left from school . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
When the coast was stripped out, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,.
And then, I did.
I beat the ratings of my rival, just a little bit one.
All the way . And I'll wake up the book to the, but, to see, some of my other colleagues had very good grades.
So in a brakes, I all around the world, no imagination.
I put everyone from D and myself a row like this, just to be there ,.
I still surprise what I did.
I didn't understand how the idea came.
I don't understand why I felt good.
I felt important.
I don't understand why they never caught me . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It was all profoundly obvious.
I never discovered me . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But most of all, I apologize the reason that I was bothered that this little girl, so small, it was so good for organizer.
I'm intrigued by the jealousy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They are so mysterious and so.
We know that babies suffer of jealousy.
Also the primates . supermassive birds are very likely.
We know that the cells are the number one cause of angiogenesis in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that analyzes the loneliness, or the long duration or sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab in which cells are studying in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's a exaggeration to to say that if there was no jealousy, there would be no literature.
So there would be no Helen the infinite, there would be``Odymine . ''
There would be no king, no``The thousand and a night . ''
There would be no Shakespeare . . . . . . . .
They disappear the reading lists of high school, because we're losing``The noise and the Fard ,"there would be no, there would be``Gabby"or``Fear . ,"and``And Ander Bone . ''
No jealousy, there's no Proton . I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers for everything, and in terms of, almost that has all of them.
This year , 100 years of his masterpiece, ,```` In search for lost time ,"the most exhaustive study of the sexual cells of sexual cells and also from ordinary competitiveness, mine, everything we could have, and thinking about Proton, ,, , ,? . ,? . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a marching magnetic in you.
We forget what that image is.
We forget what it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia Wolfe said were as hard as a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I don't know how it is, but we assume it's super.
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the jealousy; the cells and Prozac.
It will be very obvious as the jealousy, who are reduced to the person, to their desire, to their taxes, are a a . . .?
I don't know . I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
By being at the time and the, we know exactly what details will include, to closed the knife, right?
The cells make us all amateur novelists, and that is something that Prozac understood . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
All that she does to give me pleasure could give pleasure to another one, maybe right now . ''
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, Proust says that every cool charm that Stanford detects on his lover, , collection of top of torture of torture instruments.
You have to admit that Steven and Prozac, were literally jealous.
You know, Professor's boyfriend had to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to so close to recognize that it's hard work . Right?
The jealousy is exhausting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's a hungry emotion . You have to feed it.
And how are cells?
The cells are nurtured from information . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The cells use details.
The cells like the large amounts of bright hair and the cute and little storyteller.
The cells are nurtured from pictures.
That's why Instagram is so successful, it protected the language of the language with the jealousy.
When Steven is in his jealousy agony, they suddenly hear behind the doors and sounds to the signals of his lover lover, , . . .
He says, , I know that you think this is disgusting, but it's not not different to an ancient text interpretation or looking at a memorial.
He says, is scientific research with real intellectual value.
I was trying to prove that the jealousy is trying to prove that the cells are untouchable, and they make us look absurd, but, in their deathbed, they are search for knowledge, search for real, a, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The pain, the humiliation, ,: ,.
He says, ,``A woman who we need, that makes us suffer, causes us to a range of much deeper feelings and vital feelings than a wise that can be interested . ''
Are we telling us that we're going to look for women cruel?
No . I think it's trying to say that cells reveal ourselves.
And there's any other emotion that makes us open in this particular way? way? .?
Is there any other emotion gives us our aggression, our horrible ambition and our rights?
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at so peculiar?
Freud would write about it later . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
One day, Freud was visited by a young young man who is consumed with the idea that his wife would be fooled . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And Freud says there was something strange in that man, who didn't look at what his wife did.
So she was innocent; everybody knew it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But he was looking for things that his wife did, without realizing, involuntary behaviors . .
Is it a lot too much, or does it accidentally run with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the unconscious advice of his wife.
novels are very good at this.
novels describe very well how cells make us look at intensity but no precision.
In fact, the more intensely jealous we are, the more we become the fantasy of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the cells take us violent or illegal acts.
The cells are pushing us to behave in completely unimaginable ways.
Now I'm thinking about my eight years, I, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . . . .
A woman from 52 of 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account of Facebook, horrible, horrible messages for a year.
For a year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
She was trying to invite the new bride of his former boyfriend . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Because we're realistic.
How enormous, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's like novel.
Like from a Nigeria Hispown novel.
Smith is one of my favorite . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
She's a very bizarre and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the``strangers in a train ,"and``The talented Mr. Richard ,"books that are dealing with how the cells, they confuse our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in the realm of the cells, the membrane that separates what it might be to be, can be perfect in an instant.
We take Tom Rick, his most famous character.
Tom Riley is going to want or want what you have to be able to get to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get to put to what you ever have, and it's under the floor . responds to your name, it takes your rings, you empty your bank accounts.
It's one.
But what do we do?'s route.
I can't give you all the world, as much as you would.
It's a pity, because we live in an envy time.
We live in cells of jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social networks, where the currency is envy? Right?
Are novels showing the? I . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So we're going to do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they are in a mystery.
Let's go to 212 of Baker Street and ask Shakespeare Holmes.
When people think of Hollywood, he thinks about malnutrition in the Monterey Professor, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But I've always predicted [unclear] Lester, the the record face of Schollen Arm rat, which needs Holmes desperately, ,, ,, ,, ,.
Oh, , it sounds so familiar.
And Lesters need his help, but the resilient, and the bubble with bitterness in each one of the.
But as they work together, something starts changing, and finally in``The Avenue of the Six Nations ,"once the Netherlands comes in, he's going to go through all of his solution, Lesters comes back to Holmes and says,``We're not jealous, Mr. Holler . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We're proud of you . ''
And it tells him there's no person in Second York who would not want to transplant her hand.
It's one of the few times that we see Holly disorders in history . It seems very emotional . That scene is also mysterious, right? . ,? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It seems to treat the cells as a geometry problem, without emotion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You know, in a minute, the opposite side of Lesterland.
The next minute is the same side.
All of a sudden, Lesters are allowed to admire that idea of being him.
Could it still be that simple?
What if the cells are really an issue of geometry, just a question where we allow ourselves to be in relationship with the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to resist the greatness of the other.
We can align us with it.
But I like the planning plans.
So while we expect that to happen, we remember that we have the fiction to preserve ourselves.
Only the fiction of the despair.
Fiction alone, I invite them to the table.
And look at what's clustering: the sweet Lester, the Professor Tom Richard, , Mach Protector . .
We're in great company . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 , 1969, Buxine Alpress jumped outside the moon module of Apollo 11 and discovered on the Transition Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, a.
The Apollo program was the most mobility in peace times in the history of the U.S.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including Apollo 1.
But before the final Apollo program , 24 men traveled to the moon.
Twelve walked on its surface, which Alexander after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the oldest.
So why was it?
They didn't bring a lot back : 38 pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 would be sick later, ,, a new sense of our, and fragility of our home.
Why were it? The cynical response is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets, that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at at in the University of Rice in 1962 gives us a better idea.
John F. Kennedy: : Some questions, ,?? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?? .? .?? .?? .?? .?? .?? .?? .?? .??
Why will it convert it in our goals??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
And you might also ask ask ask, ,, why do you scale the mountain higher?
35 years ago, why do you fly on the Atlantic?
Why plays Rice against Texas?
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they are difficult . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Jason Pune: :: For the contemporaries, the Apollo was not just a West victory on the East War.
At the time, the strongest emotion was to marvel before the power of technology.
They were because it was something great to do.
The landing on the moon happened in a a a a a a.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the police was eradicated and removed smallpox.
The technology seemed to be able to put what Alvin tofu in 1970 called the``accelerating force . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a, , or a sailing ship, ,, , 20 flew to 40,000 miles.
Since 1970, no human being has come back to the.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo 10, and the optimism joy about the power of technology has been evaporated to see that technology would solve as to go to Mars, create clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population appear to be international.
I remember seeing the Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I don't look at the escape tube called the Saturn V . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket . rocket
I knew that this would be the last moon mission, but it was completely sure that I would come to see the colonies on Mars.
So that,``Something happened to our ability to solve problems with technology ,"has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it during the last two days here at TED.
It seems like technologists would have been distributed and had been destroyed with trivial toys, things like iPhones, ,, and social networks, or algorithms that accelerate automated sale.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They have expanded and enriched our lives . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a paranormal explanation in Silicon Valley, which confessed that you've created less ambitious companies than the years in which Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Gene . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Silicon Valley says that markets are guilty, concrete, incentives that risk capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the investment of risk caused it to change the creation of transformative ideas for financial problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It explains mostly what's going wrong in Silicon Valley . . .
Even when risk capitalists were at at its very large point without worrying about risk, they'd prefer small investment, mineral investment that they could get in 10 years.
The CERN . They've always had problems to investment in technologies as energy, which need a huge capital, and whose development is in the long term, and they have never invested in the development of the technology that we have to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we picked up not the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we want.
NASA has even designed a plan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But going to Mars to need a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't fix the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption will arise from renewable energy sources like solar, wind and biofuels, less than two percent, and reason is completely economic.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than biological.
We want alternatives of alternative energy that can compete on price . They don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what political and treaties will incentivize the development of an alternative energy: mostly, , a significant increase in research and development and and some kind of control of carbon prices.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy policy of the U.S. or international treaties that reflect that consensus . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Sometimes the big problems that look technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for a time that famines are a result of failure in food repair.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect food distribution.
The technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and food repair, but there will be famines as there were bad governments.
Finally, the big problems are often choosing a solution because we don't understand the problem really.
President Nixon is declared war to cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some often resilient to treatment, and only in the last 10 years seem to have found effective and viable treatments.
The hard problems are hard . . .
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can, and we should, but these four elements have to be present: political leaders and population must want to to solve the problem; institutions should support the solution; it must really be a technological problem, and we must understand it.
The Apollo mission, which has become something like a for the ability of technology to solve big problems ,.
But it's an unpredictable model in the future . .
We're not in 1961 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There's no gravitational competition like in the Cold War, there's no politicians like John Kennedy that hit the difficult and the dangerous, and there is no, there is a a a fiction, to explore the solar system . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In general, going to the moon, it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And really, I wasn't even solving any problem.
We're alone in our in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows we don't miss the challenges.
Thank you.
Well, , I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by remembering the widespread ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they have become cliches of our society . . . .
I think are three.
The first one is a romance: there's been a great decline of trust, is a . . .
The second is an objective: we should have more confidence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And third is a task: we should recover trust.
I think the clock, the goal and the task has been wrong.
What I'm going to try to tell today is a different story about a romance, an objective and a task, which I think gives a clearer idea about the subject.
First of all, what do people think that trust has decreased?
And if I think about the base of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I'm encouraged to think that there may have been diminished in some activities or institutions and that could have escalated in others.
I'm not clear.
But I can turn to the views of opinion, and opinion surveys are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has declined.
When you look at the views of opinion over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were described 20 years ago, mainly journalists and political, , inspired the same mistrust.
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are pretty reliable: judges, nurses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The rest we are in the, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway.
But is this evidence, enough?
What the views of opinion opinion are, of of course, opinions.
What else can you record?
What they observe is generic attitudes that people manifest when certain questions are asked.
Conference in politicians? Trust the teachers?
Now, if someone asks you,``Do you trust the vegetables?
Would you trust fishermen?
Do you rely on elementary teachers? ''
You'd probably start to say,``To do what? ''
And that would be a very sensible answer . .
And you could say, when you have answered your question,``Well, trust in some, but in others . ''
It's very rational . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deal with confidence differently.
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel like a certain kind of official, working or kind of person, will be uniforms in all cases.
I could, for instance, say I trust a certain primary teacher I know to give the kind of reading, but in a way to drive the school microbes.
After all, I, I could know it wasn't a good driver.
I could trust my most crazy friend to keep a conversation, but not maybe to keep a secret . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Simple.
And if we've got those of those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is different, why do we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a . confidence? . confidence? . confidence?.
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real confidence, because they try to be able to target the good judgment in the fact to trust something or somewhere.
Second, what about goal?
The goal is to have more confidence . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal . .
It's not the goal that I'm going to pursue.
I'd like to have more confidence in what's confidence deserve, but not what it is.
And in definition, I am a believer to don't trust what's not reliable.
And I think that those people who hate their savings with the very cleverly called Mr. Madoff, who then disappeared with them, I, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
So trust or denied with intelligence, that's the right goal . . .
Once you say it, that says, ,, ,, ,, , that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it is about doing a trial about how trustworthy people are in particular aspects.
And I think to be able to make a trial, we're obliged to focus on three things.
Are they competitive? Are they honest??? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .???????????????????????????????????
And if we found that a person is competent in the, and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to trust.
But if, in contrast, they are not responsible, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but it wouldn't trust them to to take a letter to the, because they're forget.
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that you overestimate your own competition.
And I'm very happy to say I think I don't have a lot of friends that are competitive and responsible but extremely deforestation.
If it's like this, I still don't realize.
But that's what we're looking for: trust . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
trust is the answer.
trustworthiness is what we have to judge.
And of is hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build accountability systems for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and so on, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as they should.
I remember once I was talking to a wall, and he said,``Well, you'll see the, the is the problem is that it takes more time to do the administrative paper than I would attend the . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And we found the same problem in our all our public life, and institutional, ,, , the accountability system that is destined to ensure trustworthiness and the evidence tests, is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is we'll figure out the work of people who have to do hard tasks, like the midwives, to show you that``the boxes ,"as we say.
You're sure you all know similar examples.
All of that, for the goal.
I think the goal should be more trustworthiness, and that things would be different if we're trying to be worthy of trust and we will transfer to people who are trustworthy and if we're trying to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy . It's the trial, the simple actions, the attitudes, what it doesn't properly do.
Third, the task.
It will call the task to rebuild trust, put things backwards.
It suggests you and I should rebuild trust.
Well we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild the trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, ,, , trying to better.
But trust, in definition, is distinctive, because we have some other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you . .
You have to give them enough for you to trust yourself.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't be fooled, usually, all the people, all the time.
But you also have to bring out the feeling that you are worthy of trust . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
How do we do it?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
That's been done every day, everywhere, the common people, the officials, the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I bought my socks, says I can bring them without giving explanations.
I get them to them, and I get back to the money, or they change them for the I want.
That's great . I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If you get vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So at the end, I think that what we're pointing is not something very hard to discover.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that frame, they can determine when and how other person is trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers, we've come working to reduce the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen in which imagination can be solved.
This separation has been reduced, increasingly and and more, to such a point today is less than one millimeter, the glass of the glass of a, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I wonder: and there was no barriers?
I started imagining how it would be.
First of all created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong oppressor against screen transfer their physical body to pixels.
Designers can kill their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen . . .
So with this tool, they break the barriers.
But the two hands are still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the hands of hands?
In the in the division of Microsoft applied Science, along with my mentor City Borbumben, , redesigned the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital work area.
By combining a transparent visit with deep cameras to detect the toes and face, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , and grab pixels directly with hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, , to as easy as to grab a book of a shelf . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You can stand up the book and address lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is down on every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their machines directly with hands.
So in these examples, we're moving in the digital world.
What if we invest the papers and make digital information come to us?
Surely, many of us will have bought and returned to the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is an online virtual trial.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted in mind or translucent when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physical so that we can touch them and feel?
What would a future like this?
In the Media Lab at MIT with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii and my collaborator Remocks Post, we created this only physical pixel.
This specific magnet is behaving as a in space, which means that both computer as users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
By simplicity, what we did was embrace gravity and control movement through a combination of magnetic levitation, mechanical and detectors.
And when we digitally program the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can record and reproduce and stay forever in the physical world.
You can teach physical choreography and distance, and the famous shot from Michael Jordan can reproduce as a physical reality the times we want.
Students can use it as tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real, palpable experience that you can play and feel . . . . .
But what's more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information won't only show us something, but start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to disconnect our world.
We started talking about today talking about a barrier, but if we suppress that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained to become a gym for two years in Hong, China, in the '70s . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to transfer a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my mother said, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they created firmly that there was only a, ,, , safe work.
No matter if work would like me or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer . . .
This was me, on my imaginary piano.
A opera singer must begin to train from very young to learn the tricks, so I tried everything I to to go to opera school . .
I was writing at the director of school and a radio program.
But no adults would miss the idea.
No adults I was serious.
Only my friends supported me, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at 15 years old, I knew it was too much greater to train.
My dream would never be done.
I feared, that during the rest of my life, a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved another vocation.
Nobody around me wanted to teach me? Okay.
I remember the books.
(" Completely Other Chinese"] [unclear] [Charles' [``] [`` lessons from history"] I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were banned in China, of course.
\" The Great Earth"is the Chinese compassionate life.
And it's not convenient propaganda . I understood.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a theme for another day . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But the fifth commandment for me was a revelation: :,``honoring your father and your mother . ''
\" honoring, ,"I, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So it became my tool to come out of this unified blame trap and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I meet a new culture also gave me a place to my comparative reading habit.
It's a lot of perspectives.
For instance, at first, this map seemed to me, because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to, China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
Compassion reading is not new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like comparison and comparison literature.
Compare and contrast, , offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And I thought, if comparison reading worked to investigate, why don't we also do it in everyday life?
So I started reading books from two . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You can treat people [Benjamin Frankina ,"] [`` John Adams"by David McChid who were involved in a same subject, or friends with shared experiences.
For the Christ, the tensions are economic, policies and spiritual . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For Buddha, they are all psychological: , it's all psychologists, fear and social duty -- interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
[" The journey of Chuck Tzu"] [`` The Road The Road"] Instead of forgive me in the translation, ,, found that you can win a lot.
For instance, it's through the tradition that I realized that happiness in Chinese literally means``quick joy ."Ha!
And``bride"in Chinese, literally means``new mother . ''
The books opened me a magic door to connect to people from the past and the present.
I know it won't get back to feeling just or powerless.
Having a sleeping dream really is nothing compared to what many other people have suffered . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I've come to believe that reality is not the only purpose of a dream.
The most important purpose is to connect to the place that dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
To a broken dream, you can do that.
And it's thanks to books, which I'm here today, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always accompanied them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I first psychological client.
I was a PhD student in clinics in Berkeley.
She was a 26 year-old woman called Alex.
Alex entered the first session using jeans and a hunting elbow, he threw up in the sofa of in my office, and he turned out the shoes and said he wanted to talk about her problems with men.
When I heard this, I so ,.
My classmates had a sign as a first client.
And I took a I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But I didn't.
With the funny stories that Alex brings to the sessions, it made me easy to move my head while we were going to pull the solution.
\" The Thirty are the new 20s ,"he said Alex, and so I saw, she was right.
You start working later, it's married after, ,, ,, , . .
For veterans like Alex and I had time.
But shortly after, my supervisor was pressing me to press Alex to talk about his loving life . . .
I was resistant.
I said,``Of course, it's coming out with guys under his category, and it meets a head, but it's not like to marry with him . ''
And then my supervisor said,``Not yet, but maybe you marry the next.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before it married . ''
This is what psychologists call an``Aha! ''
It was when I realized that the '30s are not the new 20.
Yeah, people feel head after what was used, but this didn't make the 20 of Alex were a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This made the 20 of Alex were the the, and we were wasting it.
So I realized, that this kind of benign recklessness was a, , not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the veterans of all over.
There are 50 million veterans in the United States today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider that nobody comes to adulthood without the 20th.
Hands up if you are in your 20s.
I want to see the veterinarians here.
Oh, yeah! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If you work with veterans, you love a vet, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . .
This is not just my opinion . These are the facts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We know that 80 percent of key moments in life will be 35.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments,``Aha ,"which give her life to their life, they would have happened to when they have 30 and so many.
People from over 40, they don't panic in panic.
This audience will be good, I think . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on how much money they win.
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live or they are coming out with their future.
We know that the brain finishes its second and last growth stage in their 20th and it's reprogramming for adulthood, ,, ,, ,, ,, to change.
We know that personality changes more times during their 20s than in any other moment of life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top at 28, and things become complicated at 35.
The 20 are the time to educate on their body and their choices.
When we think about developing the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a and common life has an impact on the person who will become.
But what we don't hear often is that there is something called adult development and our 20 are a critical moment in adult development . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But this is not what the veterans are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes on the line of adulthood.
The researchers call the 20 an extended adolescence.
The journalists are charged by journalists like``Twitter"and``little kids . ''
It's true . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As a culture, we've considered a triviality that actually is the decade that the adult defines.
Leonardo Bernstein said that to achieve great things, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Is not true?
What do you think happens when you give a veil in your head and say,``Are you 10 years to start your life? ''
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and its ambition and it's absolutely nothing.
And then every day, smartphones, interesting like you or your children and daughters come to my office and you say something like this:``I know my boyfriend is not good for me, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Or they say,``Everybody says that as a race begins before the 30, everything will be fine . ''
But then it starts to sound something like this:``My 20 are to finish and I have nothing to show.
I had better the day I graduated from university . ''
And then it starts to sound like this:``My dates during the 20 were like chairs.
They all run and fun, but then at some time around the 30, the music went off and they all started sitting.
I didn't want to be the only to be stopped, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he was 30 . ''
Where are the vets here??? . .? . . .? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little extreme, but it's not wrong, the risks are very high.
When they leave a lot of things for the 30, there's a huge pressure to the Thirty and so many of us start a career, choose a city, choose a, ,, ,, ,, ,, . period.
Many of these things are not compatible, and there are research that begin to show, which is much more difficult and stressful to doing everything in the 1930s.
The average military crisis is not about buying red car cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You cannot realize you can't have the child you want now, or you can't give you a brother.
A lot of transitions and currencies look at themselves, , and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their 20, , ,? ,? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?.
I want to change what the veterans are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it could be . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's a story about a.
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
I said I'd like to work on art or entertainment, but you couldn't still decide, so I spent the last few years working as a teacher.
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend that showed more temperaments than ambition.
And despite living 20 very difficult, their previous life had been even harder.
It was often crying in our sessions, but then he lifted up her himself by saying,``You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Well, one day, Emma came up with his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for directors, and I had spent all morning fill it with its many contacts, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I was at the next to the story when he saw me and said,``Who will be to me if I have an automobile accident?
Who is going to take care of me if you give me cancer? ''
At that point, ,, , I would resist and don't say,``I . ''
What Emma needed was not a therapy that really cares about.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex to just sit as the decisive decade of Emma passed in front.
So for the next weeks, and months, ,, I said to Emma three things that all Venezuelan, man or woman, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
First, I told Emma to forget about that identity crisis and it's got identity capital.
For identity of identity, I mean to do something that gives value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be.
I didn't know the the the, the future of Emma's career, and nobody knows the future of the work, but I know this: identity capital generating identity capital.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, of that internal, of that company you want to test.
I'm not looking at the exploration, I'm looking at the exploration that I should not tell, which, by the way, is not exploration . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's projection.
I said to Emma to explore jobs and would tell them to tell.
Second, I, I told Emma that urban tribes are overloaded.
The best friends are great to getting to the airport, but the veterinarians who are together with friends with similar minds are limited in terms of who they know, how they think, ,, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will leave almost always from outside of its closest circle.
The new ones come from what are called the weak friends of friends of their friends.
Yeah, half of the veterans have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half don't, and the the weak ties are the kind of color.
Half of the jobs created never published, then, to know the boss of your neighbor is how to get a job not published.
It's not cheating . It's the science of how information is happening.
Finally, not less important, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, ,, friends.
This was true when I was growing, but as a version, Emma soon to choose his family, when he's got a couple and her his own family.
I said to Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think the 30 is better age than the 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or you do now, when everyone in Facebook starts walking down, not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have it, and that means to be as an intense in love as you are in work.
To choose your family must be a conscious choice of who, and what you want instead of just making it work or kill time to whatever you are to you.
So what about Emma?
Well, we looked at that director, and she found the roommate of a cousin that worked on an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there . . .
That job supply gave him a to the that he lived.
Now, five years later, it's special organized for museum events.
This married man who chose consciously.
She loves his new career, he loves his new family, and I send me a, ,, ,, the emergency spaces are not big enough . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The story of Emma can sound easy, ,, , but that's what I I love with versions.
It's very easy to help them.
The veterans are like airplanes that come out of the Los Angeles Airport, who are out there.
Just before you go down, a slight fit in your trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the same way, at the age 21 or 25, and even 29, a good conversation, a good speech, a, , can have huge effects in the following years or even in the following generations.
Here's my idea of spreading all the veterans you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alex.
It's what I'm now privileged to say to veterans like Emma every day: The Trees are not the new 20, they call their adulthood, they get identity capital, they use their weak ties, they choose your family.
They don't let you define what you didn't know or what you didn't do . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They're deciding their life today . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Thank you.
When I was 27, I left a very picky job in a giant consulting job for a, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I went to show you mathematics to sex students in New York City.
And like any professor, and applied exams and tests . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I give you tasks.
When the work came back, calculated the ratings.
What I called the attention was that the C. . was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of you who had a better performance didn't have Chinese scores.
Some of my smartest children didn't get them so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But these concepts are not impossible, and was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they were working hard and during enough.
After several years, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a motivating perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's the C., but what if to succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn differently and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a psychologist.
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of scale scenarios, and in every study, my question was, who's successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the West Political Academy.
We tried to predict what chains would stay in military training and who would retire.
We went to the National State competition, and we tried to predict what children were going to move the most possible in competition.
We study novel teachers working in really hard neighborhoods, ,, ,, ,, ,, to the end of the school and those who will be the most effective to improve the learning of their students' learning?
We partnered with private companies, wondering, which of these marketers are going to keep their job?
And who will make more money?
In all of those very different contexts, a feature arose as an important predictive success.
And not social intelligence.
It wasn't the good appearance, physical health, and it wasn't the C. .
It was determination.
The determination is passion and perseverance to reach goals very long.
The determination is to have resistance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The determination is clinging to their future, day after day, not just a week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a marathon, not a career at all . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A few years ago, I started studying determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my determination questionnaires and then wait around over a year to see who would be recorded.
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater likely to growing, even when they were in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of standardized testing, even security that children were when they were in school . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So it's not not just in West Point or in the National State competition in which determination is also in school, especially for children in risk to absorbed it.
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, the little bit that science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me,``How do you develop determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid job ethic?
How do you keep them motivating for the long term? ''
The most honest answer is: I don't know . What I know is that talent doesn't give you determination.
Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals that just don't follow with their commitment.
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly not related to it, or is even related to the talent measures.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing determination in kids is something called growth mindset.
This is a developed idea at Stanford University by Carol Dr., and it's the belief that ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with effort.
Dr. Dewey has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and how it changes in response to challenge, they're much more likely to thrive when they fail, because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea to develop determination . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because there's where we are.
That's the work we have in front.
We need to take our best ideas, our strong intuitions, and we need to test them.
We need to measure if they've been successful and we need to be to fail, to wrong, to start all again with the lessons learning.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more determined.
Thank you.
Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a stroke, one of my most frightening memories is my mother showing beauty, the shape and shape of Chinese characters.
From that moment, , this incredible language.
But for an foreigners, it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall Wall.
And in the last few years, ,, ,, , I, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, and that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language.
So I started thinking about how a new new and rapid method to learn Chinese could be useful.
Ever since I was five, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Because we only have five minutes, it better than we do it a faster and simple way . .
A Chinese academics would understand 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 percent will allow you to understand 40 percent of basic literature, enough to read transit signals, menus of restaurants, to understand the basic idea of websites or newspapers.
Today to start to show you how the method works.
Are they ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it's square.
Get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
People.
And if the shape of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if it's shouting in a very neat way, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is a tree.
tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree tree
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The door of the door looks like a couple door door in the old West . . . . . . . . .
I call this eight characters.
They're building blocks to believe a lot more characters.
A person.
If someone walks back, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As the says the ancient said, two are company, three are crowd.
If one person would be their arms, this person is saying,``It was that big . ''
The person inside the, the person's catch.
It's a prisoner, as Jon inside the whale.
A tree is a tree . Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a board under the tree, you have the foundations.
Put a mouth on the tree, that is an idiot . Easy to remember, because a a is pretty idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two fire together, it becomes very hot . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Three fires together, that's a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You put the the, you get the, you put the two trees down the, that's burn.
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, it's prosperous.
Three together, those are seals.
You'll put the the and the the moon shining together, that's the glowing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It also means tomorrow after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the horizon . It love . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A door . Get a board inside the door, it's the door color.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
I played, did there be somebody at home?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
This person is coming out of a door, scarically scored.
On the left, , we have a woman.
Two women together are discussing.
Three women together, being careful.
So we've gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build another 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as a eight year-old Chinese.
So after I met the characters, we started creating phrases.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a fire mountain . It's a volcano.
We know Japan is the land of the born sun.
This is a sun with the origin, because Japan is the east of China.
So a sun next to the origin, created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what are we?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains piled on the other . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese emperor would destroy their political enemies beyond mountains . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Today, exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you to go out is a output.
This is a slide to remind me I should stop talking and down from the stage . Thank you.
What I want to be of being Dad are the movies I . . . .
I love sharing my favorite movies with my children, when my daughter was four, we saw the Oklahoma magician.
The film mastered his imagination for months . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Her favorite character was Glenn, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It gave him a to a, and bring a magic wand.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of industrial fantasy show.
However, the Wizard magician was an event in itself . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It didn't start that trend . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The trend really took rise for a couple of years later with, interestingly, another film whose protagonists, , a and a, a blood girl rescued a young girl as an enemy.
You know what I'm talking about? Yes.
There's a big difference between these two movies, ,, ,, ,, , there is a a, and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence on the Oz magician.
monkeys are pretty aggressive, like apples.
But I think that, if Oz's magician is done today, the magician would say,``Dorothy, you are the the, as the prophet predicted it . ''
They use magic shoes to defeat the computer-generated army computer.
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the Oz magician is that the most heroic, wiser characters are women.
I started noticing this when I made Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the the second child, and the level of survival had gone down . So, it was declared in the room, and so, it was shot up in the room, and he was shocked like a mom leg, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but unfortunately, he absorbs everything . . . . . .
I wonder what perceived.
Would they be issues of value, perseverance and loyalty?
Would I have the feeling that Luke is an army to defeat government?
Let's compare this to the 1981 magician.
How do you win your film?? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .? . . .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?
By doing good minutes with everyone and being a leadership.
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up Oz, right?, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Why is it so much capital force, , force in movies for our children, and so little the yellow brick path?
There's a lot literature about the impacts of male violence movies in girls, and they should read it . It's very good.
I haven't read much about how kids react to this stimulus.
Now, I know for experience that the Queen Prince doesn't provide the right frame that I would have served me to navigate the world of adults that is blended . ., , I really expected to start appearing because it's the end of, right?
My search has finished, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Why do you keep there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focus on defeat the villain and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other adventures.
It's almost like to be a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a, ,, you have to use a war suit.
There are many exceptions, and to defend Disney's princess in any of you.
But they send a message to children, although they, the boys are not really their objective public.
They do a phenomenal job to teach girls how to defend the, but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the patriarchy.
There's no model for them . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real, as real as Hemishama and Kateles, but they don't stop being a war movie.
Of course, the most successful theme of all time continues to classic after classic, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Until, like many of you are thinking, this year, I finally went wild.
I recommend all of you . It's already available in stores.
Remember what the critic said when courageous came out?
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's very good . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Well, almost none of these movies is going on at the Mechanical test.
I don't know if you've heard about this . . . . . . .
It has still not roots and spread, but maybe we'll start a movement.
Alisa Leschus is a, ,, , and in the middle 1980s, I recorded a conversation I had with a friend of the evaluation of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple . questions: in the movie, is there more than a female character than have lines? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .? . . . . .? . . .? .? .? .?.
So, you have to fulfill the requirement.
These women talk each other at some point in the film?
Your conversations are about something more apart from the kid than you like? Okay? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Two women who exist and talk about things.
It happens . I've seen, and yet, I see it in the film that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality film, Archie.
Right? Well, Oscar tumors, headache success, an idea of what a Hollywood Hollywood film is.
Pretty much, it doesn't have the Beach test.
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the film, I, ,, ,, ,, ,, , in a pregnant, where men and women hid during the hostage crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this hiding, and it's the the big time for one of the, and that is a look at the door, and say,``Do you come to bed, honey? ''
This is Hollywood.
So you look at the numbers.
In 2011, from 100 more popular movies, how many of them believe they have female protagonists?
Eleven . It's not wrong.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But there's a bigger number that is going to disappoint this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what said.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted ever in their life.
I don't think the blame of mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music or pornography videos are highly linked, but something wrong with, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual aggression.
Who are these guys? What are they learning?
What don't you get to learn?
Are you looking at the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat villain with violence, and then it's going to turn the reward, , which is a, and doesn't talk?
Are we adding that story?? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?.
You know, like a parent with the privilege to raising a, like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world, and this very alarming statistics and we want to prepare them.
We have tools to our as a power of power, and we hope that that helps, but I have to ask to ask, will you protect them if, at the same time, active or passively, are we educating our children to keep their male power?
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to do something really important, and I mean mainly to parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of shoulder.
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You'll read about how new economy is changing the role of home and alarm.
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter, what was his favorite character of Star Wars, he responded?
Obama.
Oben Kennedy and Global.
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think are experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anybody, and you love to share their knowledge with other people to help them achieve their potential.
They are leaders . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, , and I like that kind of stories for my son . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories to say to my son,``Come on and struggle just and more stories where you see that his work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people better and be better people, like the Oz magician . ''
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine, and one of the things I'd like most was to look for sea cookies in Maine's shores because my parents told me that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these shells.
They are covered in sand and it's hard to see.
But over time, I used to look for them.
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me collecting them.
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for past and archaeology.
And finally when I started studying Egyptian, I realized that seeing my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown to one of a hundred miles away from the Nile.
My sea cookies had grown up the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
So to try to make a map of the past, ,, I knew it had to see otherwise.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the infrared.
This is a place located in the eastern delice of Egypt called Benjamin.
And the place, in a simple sight, seems to being brown, but when we use the infrared, and we processed it using false color, suddenly the place looks like brilliant pink.
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes of the landscape that are caused by materials and the activities of ancient Egyptians.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city called Italian, lost for thousands of years.
Italian was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in El Francisco, Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of old Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
The Egyptians have always known that Italian was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that build them, indicate within the red circles here, but somewhere within this enormous rainfall planning . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This area is huge, , it's about 65,000 miles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So before, the Nile is flowing right on the side of Italian, and as that it changed over time, it it comes into this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a speed city in an extensive landscape? . .
Try to find it random would be the equivalent to looking for a needle in a haystack, with the eyes sold and using baseball gloves.
So we use NASA traveling data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We could see where the Nile is flowing.
But you can see more detailed, and even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see within the circle here, that we think it could be the location of Italian.
So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists doing show jobs; you can see it.
When I say a show, it's like the shots in ice, but instead of climate change, we're looking for layers of human occupation.
Five meters below a, , we found a dense layer of ceramics objects.
This means that in this possible location of iconic interview, five meters below, we have an occupation layer of several hundred years from the Middle Empire, exactly the same period that we believe is Italian.
We also found words of bakery, coral, quartz and cat; what it shows there was a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This may seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common rocks used in the the Middle Empire jewelry, these are the stones they used.
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that's from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry workshop that shows that what's been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find integrity here, but we'll go back in a close future to localize it.
And even more important, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire, probably was written in Italian 4,000 years ago.
sharing knowledge is most of all vaccines.
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So it looks like, TED was not founded in 1984 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It made the ideas happen really started in 1984, in a lost city, not a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts seawater in perspective.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine outside the door.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that it's made.
Now they're going to visit a group of obese nurseries in bicycles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You're competing in a, and you're going on the direction door.
I need you to see this.
They are defining strong, they're sweating, they're leaving a lot.
And they collide against your house door.
There are bicycles flying over all parts, wheels that go on to their side, rays of the wheels that end up in absurd places . They pass the door.
At the lobby, to the, or what there is on the other side of the door, and you see the quality of light . . .
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, chair.
It's a.
You can feel your blue blue box by making them tickle.
You can smell the bird cookie and you can smell that it's about to get in the mouth.
They're going to one side and enter your living room.
And in the room, and doing maximum use of your imagination, imagine British Spears . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's a little clothing, dancing about his center of center, singing``Haiti me Baby Morning . ''
Now let me go to the cook.
The ground has been coated with a yellow brick path, and from the oven, they come to you Dorrigor, the Maharo, the Spanish and the``The Wizard of Oz ,"accompanied hands, jumping into you.
Okay . Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes every spring in New York City.
It's called the``The United States Machine . ''
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist, hoping, I guess, that this was like the end of a wise superconductor.
There were several men and a few different ages of different ages and different hygiene habits.
They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers, looking at them just once . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They memorize the names of tens and tens of strangers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They memorize entire poems in just minutes.
They compete to see who could memorize the order of a deck of a deck.
And I thought,``This is incredible . ''
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man called Ed Cook that had come from England and has one of the best trained memories . .
I said,``Hey, when you realized you were a wise? ''
He says,``I'm not a wise . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I actually have an average memory.
Everybody who participate from this competition say they have normal memory.
\" We've trained ourselves to perform these miraculous acts of memory using ancient techniques, invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques I used Cickerage to memorize their speeches, and the medieval academics used to memorize entire books . ''
And my reaction was,``Wow . ,? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .???????????????????????????????????????????
We were standing outside of the, and Ed, who is a wonderful and brilliant English, even a little bit creepy, said,``Josh, you are an American journalist.
Do you know British Spears?
And I said,``What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney Spears how to memorize order in a living vessel vessel, in national television.
That would test the the world that anybody can do . ''
And I said,``Well, I'm not Britain Spears, but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start for something not? ''
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me . . .
I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also researching it, trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what your potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called ED.
He's a lot of the world's worst memory.
Your memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a, , awesome.
So, somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how the our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim Peyo . role in the``Rain Man . ''
We went through a afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City, memorize telephone guides; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And when you go back, it's a amount of a deal of the written memory that it does something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Antarctica and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
So one of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having trained memory, discipline and cultivate, was not such a weird thing as you can look at today.
A long time ago, people invested in their memory, in providing their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world possible, but they have also changed.
They have changed culturally, ,, and I would say they have changed cognitively.
As we almost no need to remember, sometimes it looks like we have forgotten how to do.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained memory, discipline and cultivate is this very peculiar competition of memory.
It's actually not so singular; ; there's competition like this worldwide.
I was fascinated, I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at the University College University invited a group of memory champions, to the lab.
Would you want to know: Is it going to have brains in some ways, , structural or analoging different from us?
The answer was no.
Are they more intelligent than the rest?
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually no.
It had yet, ,, , a really interesting and meaningful difference between the brains of memory champions and the control subjects that we compare them.
When they put them into a magnetic resonance machine, they scan their brains as they memorize numbers, faces and shapes of snow, found that in memory champions, they were illuminating parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually use, or they seemed to use, a part of the brain that involves space memory and navigation.
Why is there something we can learn from this?
The tournament of competitive memorizing is made as an armed career where every year comes someone with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors should get to day.
This is my friend Ben Maeda, three times . .
In his desk, ,, ,, ,, there are 36 bars of characterized boats that he is about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he just mastered.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 140 random binary.
Yeah.
And while there's a to all of in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques used at the end, they are reduced to one concept that psychologists call``elaboration coding . ''
It illustrates with an elegant paradox known as the Parkinson paradox . It says the following: I'm telling two people who remember the same word . ., . . .
That's their speed.
And then I asked them,``Remember there's a battery.
And when I go back later, , and I say,``Do you remember that word I told you a while ago? ''
\" Remember what was it? ''
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the the same word as the person who told her that his work is``battlefield . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Same word, different memory capacity; that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you.
With all the other memories that they dance for their head . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But the word,``Bazarro . ''
They use simple white hats.
They have flour in hands.
They smell good when they go home to work.
We probably know a baker.
And when we first heard that word for the first time, we started putting some assemble ingredients to weigh them easily at some point.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this data from 2,500 years ago in ancient Greece.
It's known as the``memory of memory . ''
The story says this: there was a poet called similarities that I attended a bank.
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you don't bring a DJ, you hired a poet.
He stood up, he received his memory poem, and it was made, and so soon he was, the bank's room collapsed.
You kill them all.
But not only killed them all, but it destroyed the bodies by giving them unrecognizable.
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they couldn't be buried.
A tragedy behind the other.
Simple, standing outside, only survivors, , in the middle of, closed the eyes, and realized that with the eyes of his mind, he could see where every guest had been sitting.
I took the family in the hand by taking them where their ones were loved between rubble.
What similarities went through at that moment is something that we all know about, or so intuitively, and it is that no matter if we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or words of word of our colleagues, we have visual and space memory.
If you ask me to get the first 10 words of the story that I've just told you about similarities, it's very likely that it's very hard to to.
But I would bet that if you ask you to say who was sitting on the brown horse in your lobby, you would be able to visualize it.
The idea of the role of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and put it out of images with the things that you want to remember, the more crazy, far-fetched, funny, scary, appropriate is the more likely to be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, the first memory treaties, in Latin.
How does it work?
So let's say you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make it memory, in the same way that Cycingin would have done about 2,000 years ago.
What you could do, is to imagine you're on your doorstep.
And to figure out some species of absolutely ridiculous, crazy and unforgettable image, to help you remember that the first you want to mention is that completely inspired competition.
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and seeing the monster of the Matches mounted on Mister Ed . .
And that would remind you to want to introduce your friend Ed Cook.
And then they would see Britney Spears to remind that funny anecdote that they want to tell.
And then they went into the kitchen, and the fourth thing you'd talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a, ,, , to help you remember it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is how the Roman speakers memorize their speeches, not word for word, will confuse it, but typical by typical.
In fact the term``typical"comes from the Greek``top ,"which means``place . ''
It's a research of when people thought about the trial and in rhetoric with this species of space terms.
The phrase``First place ,"would be like the first place in its memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got to fill in that.
I went to some of these memory competitions, and I had the idea of writing something extinct about this computer memory subculture.
But there was a problem . . .
The problem was that a memory competition is a psychologically boring event.
Seriously, it's like to see a lot of people sitting out of exams . I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone's massage.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are incredible things happening in these people's minds, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem, or the names of an ancient school ad bought in a a . . . .
And I discovered that this was surprisingly entertaining.
I'd never expect it to be.
It was entertaining, , because it wasn't just about training memory . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What is actually about doing is to better to improve the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous images, comics, provocative, inspiring, absolutely inexperience and inexpensive, in mind.
I get stuck with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of a couple of budgets and a couple security glasses covered with tape leaving only two holes, , is the worst enemy of a memory computer.
I ended back back back at the same contest I had covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could enter, in a kind of participatory journalistic experiment.
I thought this could be a good epitope for all my research . . .
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the, something that didn't have to happen.
Now, it's cute to memorize speech, and phone numbers, and pieces of purchases, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks . tricks that work.
Because they are based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works . . .
And it's not necessary that you're going to get to build memory sticks or memorize sheets of nose, to benefit with a little bit of perspective about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was an innate gift, but it's not the.
The big memories are educate . .
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we focus deeply.
The role of memory -- these memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they are not really activists.
They work because they make us work.
They force a kind of deep processing, , a whole kind of attention that most of it doesn't walk out in there.
But the reality is there's no shortcuts.
That's how things are made of memorable.
And if there is something I want to leave you today, it's what E.U ., ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , that life is the sum of our memories . . .
How much are we willing to lose what our existing existence is already losing in Blackberring or iPhone, not paying attention to being human in front of us, who walks our, are we going to be so happy that we don't even bother in process?
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory abilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life, you have to be the kind of person I remember to remember.
Thank you.
Today, I'll talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture history.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, ,, so we just a complex place: New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I.
In the corner, from my bedroom, , I I share with my sister.
And between my dorm and the bathroom, ,, ,.
And there they all spent the time watching the television . So every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, everybody would look at me, and every time I was shower and come back into a, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And I was like.
It was awkward, insecure and hated it.
I hated that journey, hated that balcony, , hated that room.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not mathematics, ,, , the architecture is not math, but of those of those visceral connections, emotional, that we feel in the places we occupy.
And not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency spends 90 percent of its time under roof.
I mean , 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize.
That makes us a little bit naive and very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what I'm going to do: think of power,``stability ,"`` democracy . ''
And I know you think about it in a building building 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a mess that architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's a predictable emotional connection; we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to building art museums . . .
And in the 20th century, we use to build houses.
Look, these stable, solid soldiers, in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is frightening . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's expensive, , it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who build, the urban and governments, are always afraid to innovation, and prefer to use ways that you know that are going to work.
That's why we found buildings like this.
It's a nice building . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's the Public Library of Liberia that was ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a dome; it has this round thing, columns, red red, red red, that let go on what Living tries to communicate with this building: kids, property values, history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, another library, that looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to meet, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called libraries, are they so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the pendulum.
On one side there is innovation; architects that constantly drive new technologies, new things, new solutions for current life forms.
We trained, we push and we, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Everybody's black, this depressed us . You believe that we feel good, but we're dead in because we don't have another option.
We have to go next to the other side and connect to those that appreciated symbols.
And so we do, and we're all happy, but we're all happy, so we started experimenting again, and we're doing it, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, and we're going to do it in the last 300 years, and
Well , 30 years ago, we went out of the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called``bubble . ''
It has to do with the ant.
That can guess.
Small windows, on scale.
Something really hard.
So we came up with the '80s, and we started incorporating those symbols.
We push the pendulum back in the other direction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We take those shapes that we know like, and we update them.
We added them and we added pills and we use new materials.
They love.
We don't give advice.
We took Christmas closet, and we turn them into skyscrapers, which can be medieval cards made of glass.
The shapes were shocked, won in audacity and colorful.
They become columns.
The civilizations grew up to the size of buildings.
A crazy.
But they were 80, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, , we moved to neighborhoods, and in the suburbs, we can create our own architectural fantasies.
Those these fantasies could be to medicine, to French, or the Italian.
It's possible with a bread of bread sticks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is what happens to optimism.
This is what happens with symbols.
They are easy, , because instead of creating new spaces, we recreated memories from other places.
I know very well, and all you know, this is not the Toolocute.
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated, and we started doing the pendulum again in the other direction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the 1980s, in the early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called deconstructive.
We downloaded the historical symbols; we now count new techniques of design care design, and we meet new compositions, a few ways that are crashing against other shapes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is academic and emotional, ,, .; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Now, normally, the dark pendulum again in the direction.
But then something surprising happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the Girzzler of Bilbao, from Frank Gehry.
This building fundamentally changed the world's relationship with architecture.
Paul Golden said that Bilbao was one of these rare moments when critical, academic and public in general, they were completely agreed about a building.
The New York Times made this miracle construction.
The tourism in Bilbao rose in 25 percent when the building was completed.
So suddenly everybody wanted one of those buildings: Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, September.
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star architect.
But how is it possible that these shapes, wild and radical, how is it possible that they become ubiquitous environments around the world?
And it happened, because the media will pollinate around them and quickly learned that those shapes mean culture and tourism.
We created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
The same thing did the world's main mayors.
So everybody believed that if they had these shapes, they had culture and tourism.
This new millennium phenomenon happened with other star architects.
So I happened to Khatanga and Libering, and what happened to these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to happen with all the architecture . . . . .
Think, for example, how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is accelerating: ,, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The accelerating technology . You can see in the newspapers, , in the television, and at the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building becomes beyond their physical location.
Architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture . .
Because architecture moves so fast.
It's not a long time to think about a building.
You need a to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, before you know whether the one who designed four years ago was success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The brutality was not a two-year-old movement, but 20 years old . . .
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they did.
That's never going to happen . I think, because we're at in the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of concrete, steel or elevator, and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when the media is applied to communication, it starts to growing up faster and faster, and it to be in both extremes, almost in synthetic, and it's effectively lowered the difference between innovation and symbol, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Now we can make symbols almost instant, with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were hired to substitute this building.
This is the center of a village called Pine Island, in New York State.
It's a community of vacation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But that meant that two years before the building was finished, it was already part of the community, and as drawings seemed exactly to the end product, there was no surprise.
The building came to be part of the community . That first summer, when people started coming up and shared it in social media, the building stopped being only a building, became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you made of the building . . . . . . . . . .
And as you use them to tell their story, , they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes the collective memory cut, and by charge these symbols, we learn.
That is, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think architecture.
We can tell what we think of architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think for a second in those libraries of Living.
If that building was built today, we would first go to the Internet in search for``new libraries . ''
We would be bombarded with examples of experimentation, of innovation, about what a library can be.
That's ammunition.
ammunition that can lead to the mayor of Michigan, to people in Michigan, and tell them that there is no single answer to what a can be . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use gravitational words and complicated drawings, and one is no longer an unfortunate audience that doesn't accept something that has not seen before . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The architects can hear, and you don't let you integrate for architecture.
That means that the dark pendulum of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go forward and find right solutions to the problems that society faces . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that tomorrow buildings will be very different to buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of Sylvia can be and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a, , and not a bad historical imitation of red red brick brick in ideas of what a stadium should be.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because eventually we'll be ready to the ways that are going to.
That means that buildings are threatening to nature capitals and not the opposite . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to make sports or yoga for yoga, or you can get married at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming at the River River in New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, it's no longer a client.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, , like this little gang of, as mysterious as the animals who are going to observe.
Because no matter if it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build, , what matters is what we built . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The architects already know how to make more ecological and smarter buildings.
We've been expecting all of you to want them.
Finally, we're not in opposite side.
You find an architect, you'll get it and we work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings don't just reflect our society, but they give shape to the smallest spaces: ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, and the the bathroom.
Thank you.
This is my niece, Steven.
I just turned a year and started walking.
And he does it in that great, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, . .
It's totally precious.
And one of the things that you most like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves her.
It's laughing and chicken, and it gives themselves these big and expensive kiss.
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he thought,``When do you do this? ''
How do we suddenly don't have a taste with our appearance?
Because apparently, we don't like.
Every month , 10,000 people look at Google:``Am ugly? ''
This is F, , he's 13 and he lives in Denver.
And like any teenager, , it just want to be to a dear and fit.
It's Sunday at night . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's got a bit of fear, it's a little confused, because, even though her mom tells her all the time it is beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
In between what his mom tells him and what his friends, or school colleagues say, don't know who to believe.
So a video of it himself, I published it on YouTube, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Well, it's now received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so disgusting, which doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy, normal and current teenager that receives these responses in one of the in the most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate in this way . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But what's leading to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are never alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking, checking, giving me,``I like ,"starting, sharing, publishing, this never ends.
We've never been so connected before, in a continuous way, so, so young.
As a mother said,``It's like there's a party in your room every night . ''
There's just there.
And the social pressures that go from hand to that are implanted.
So this environment, to be always connected, is going on to our children to self-assemble in the number of``I like ,"you have, and the types of comments that you get.
There are no divisions between a and online life.
It's really hard to to know the differences between what is real or what is not.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and that is digitally manipulated . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What is the most heartbreaking in someone's life in front of what is normal in a daily context?
And where are they seeking inspiration?
Well, you can see the kind of images that are from the news of girls now.
So zero models still dominate our spins.
The technique of the terrain is a routine.
And trends like,``Typing ,"the biological, the beating.
For those of them who don't know it, it means profitable.
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people compare.
But kids aren't immune to this.
Like the super-controlled stars of sports, and the sandwiches.
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to our kids to grow healthy, and they're very balanced individuals . .
But in an obsessed culture, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, ,, at the price of all aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, , development of their physical abilities, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six in every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think you don't see any nice enough.
These are not trivial activities . .
They are fundamental activities for growth as human beings and as a society to society and in the workforce.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in class arguments . They avoid participating in classrooms, because they don't want to call attention for their physical aspects.
One in five are not attending classes at all during days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the exams season, if you don't believe you see enough, enough, specifically if you don't think you're thin enough, ,, you'll get a lower note to the average of your peers who don't worry about that.
And this phenomenon has grown in Finland, the United States and China.
And it's regardless of what these young people are.
So, to be clear, we're talking about how you see you, not how you are really.
The low self-esteem on his body is debilitating academia.
And it's also wasting health.
The teenagers with an self-worth do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet diet than they can bring them to a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They have low self-worth.
They're more easily influenced by the people around them, and they are in greater risk of depression.
And we think it's for all of this for what they make more risky decisions, like alcohol consumption and drugs, drastic diet, aesthetic surgery, sexual relationships to early ages and without protection and self-replication.
The search of the perfect body is preserving the healthcare, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not controlling.
Women who believe that they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have or they have no greater absorption rates.
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in one day that they don't feel safe with the way you see . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that opportunity be?
It's going to liberate this potential is for each of us.
But what do we do?
Well, speaking, on it, doesn't take you very far . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Don't do it.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And we've learned that there are three key shapes . The first is that we have to increase confidence in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure images and building their self-esteem . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I I learned that many programs that are well-intentioned, without realizing, worse.
So, we have to make sure that the program that our children follow is not only going to have a positive impact, but also a durable impact . . .
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas . The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial parties for any willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So an education is fundamental, but we'll face to face this problem requires each of us that we take the risks on the issue and we're a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not not good to deal with our politicians' input in hair cuts or the size of their breasts, or to innovating that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people for what they are, not as you see.
We can all start doing it by using responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We can praise people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was it the last time you kiss a mirror?
In short, we have to work together as communities, , as governments and as companies, to truly change our culture, so our kids grow up by valuing their whole person, valuing individuality, diversity, inclusion.
We have to put people who are really making the difference in a pedestal.
So to make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones who are coming out of the in the big screen, because we'll just create a different world.
A world in where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe you have never seen the returns of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Think what this may mean for someone in their lives.
Who's in mind?
To your wife?
Is his sister?
Is your daughter?
Is your niece? Your friend?
It could just be the the woman who is two seats of distance . . . . . . . . . . . .
What does it mean for her if we would overcome this and we would say to their potential that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is leaving us all.
But let's teach our children the truth.
Let teach teach you the way you see it is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for who they are and for what they do, and because they make us feel . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We include self-esteem in our schools.
We change each of us, the way we we talk and we compare to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little bits of an age of today, they become agents of safe change of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The five of November 1990, ,, , a gentleman called Elizabeth November entered a hotel in Manhattan and in the rabbi Mayo Kahn, , the leader of the Left Defense League.
Now, we initially declared it innocent, but being pressure for other lesser charges, in company of others, started planning attacks to about 12 concerns in New York, including tunnels, synagogues and the headquarters.
Luckily these plans were frustrated by an FBI informant.
Sadly, the 1968 bomb on the World Trade Center, couldn't be avoided.
So later, I would be convicted by their participation in that attack . . . . . . . . .
Elise note is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being her an Egyptian engineer, with a loving American mother, elementary school teacher, ,, , to give me a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven, our family started changing.
My father taught me an Islam form, that very few, including most Muslims, come to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require much to get to want to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in every human group, there's always a, there's always a little fraction of people who are so deeply clinging to their convictions that you think you have to use all possible means for everyone lived like them.
A few months before the arrest, he sat up with me and explained that in the last weekend, he and a few friends, they had been going to throw in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We get to the the the the the the the, the the, California, ,, ,, ,, , ,.
When I played my father, my father helped me hold the rifle in the shoulder and explained how to point the goal to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that shooting gave the little orange light on the goal and, to surprise all of, all the goal in flames.
My uncle went back to others and in Arabic, he said,``Iran book . ''
Such a parent, such child.
All of, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but only a few years later, I understood what was so funny.
They saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could cause . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Those people later would be condemned to put one of the road with 700 pounds of explosions in the northern tower of the northern tower of the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and died at 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them``lumpies, ,"meaning uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Every time it started to feel comfortable near someone, it was time to packing and going to another city . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As I was always me the, the was the the, the was a new new face of the kind of a storyteller.
It was a secret my identity to avoid being the white, but to be the new of the class, silence and register, it was enough ammunition.
So most of the time was going home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons, I didn't develop social skills, to say it softly ., was not prepared for the real.
They educate me to judge people, with base indicators, like their race or their religion.
So how could the eyes open?
One of the first experiences that put my way to think, was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a preventive program where I participated at the Juneliness National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was focused on the subject of juvenile violence, ,, ,, almost all my life, life, it was something that I felt a lot passion.
The members of this group came from various backgrounds.
One day, to the end of the, found that one of the guys who we had made friendships, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I took several days to go to light, and I realized that there was no animals between two.
I had never had a Jewish friend, and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had made me believe that it was frightening . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in Bush Garden, a . .
I met people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures . That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All life had been taught me that homosexuality was a sin and, for extension, all homosexual was bad influence.
By the way, , I had a chance to working with homosexual actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critical ones I had seen in life.
Having been charged in a, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy to me to treat nice people, exactly the way I wish to be treated.
So that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that had taught me about a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is to be gay, but I know what's being judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the``Daily Show . ''
Every night, Jon Stewart made me intellectually honest about my intolerance, and helped me see that people's race, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to to the character.
In many ways, he became my pathogenic figure in a moment that I desperately needed.
Sometimes, inspiration can come from the unexpected, and that a Jewish comedian had a better influence in my life than my own father, extremists, was not in vain.
And one day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that I would preserve in my heart forever, alive . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
She looked at me with somebody who had suffered enough, and he said,``I'm tired of hate . ''
At that moment, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , you need to keep all that hatred in your inside . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
My real name is not Zach Eradiat . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why decided to go out and put me in a possible risk?
Well it's simple.
I've done that because I hope someone, ,, ,, ,, you can hear violence, you can hear my story and understand that there's a, and intolerance, I didn't get to make me fantastic.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism, to talk, against those meaningless acts, as a rejection to my father's actions.
So with this simple, I I proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, ,, , they don't have to follow their parents's paths.
I'm not my father.
Thank you . Thank you all . Thank you . Thank you very much.
At this point there is a film that is projected in their minds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's an incredible molecule film . .
It's 3D, and it has a sound sound of what you hear and see right now . But that's just the beginning.
Your film has harmony, taste and texture.
It feels your body, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It's got memories, as the moments of your childhood that are projected in your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed in your conscious thinking stream . .
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in right.
This film is your belief of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of human beings.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you, you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least, I know I have an awareness.
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If we were not conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we conscious?
Why have these internal films?
Why aren't we just robots that we get to do to produce results without experiencing the internal movie?
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrating consciousness, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science, for nature, is objective.
Consciousness, by nature, is subjective.
So there can never be a science of consciousness . .
Because for almost all the 20th century, ,.
The psychology was studying behavioral behavior, neuroscience studying the brain obviously, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
Then 20 years ago, it all started changing.
neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Pennsylvania said,``now is time for science to tackle consciousness . ''
And since then, there was a real explosion, a scientific work of science work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But it also has fundamental limitations to time.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of correlation, correlation between some of the brain and and some states of consciousness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We saw something of this guy in the fantastic work that I introduced Nancy Kanzink a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling grief or to feel happy.
But this is still a citizenship science.
It's not an explanation science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you by saying that this kind of neuroscience work answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness, questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they correlate.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to neuroscientists.
There are actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, ,, I don't know the true central mystery of this stuff: :: ,, ,, , is to be being accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an subjective internal film?? film? film? film?.
At this moment, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give you a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like the emails, like hurricanes, like life, and we're going to find explanation.
typical services are all cases of emergent behaviors, how the embasitism, how hurricanes work, how hurricanes reproduce, adapt and metabolize living organisms . They are all questions about objective function.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as an emerging phenomenon: how we walk, , talk, how we play chess; they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, , questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why it is that every behavior is accompanied from a subjective experience?
And here is, the standard paradigm of the rise, the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have much to say.
I'm a heart science machine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I want a scientific theory of the highway that works . For a long time, , my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end, I got to the conclusion that didn't work for systematic reasons.
I think we're stuck at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations, great . We get used to this; physics explain chemistry, , is biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On one hand, it's a fact that we conscious.
We don't know how to deal with that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is kind of an anomaly, ,, , something we need to integrate our vision of the world, but we do we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas . I, I think we need ideas that are going to look crazy, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who is here today ,.
Its crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the inner subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
And actually, what you have to do, is to explain the objective functions, the brain behaviors, and so you study everything that needs explanation.
Well more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely reductionist awareness, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to just deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time that it's, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be promising.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental bricks: space, time and mass.
They proposed fundamental laws that governments, like gravity laws or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and properties don't explain in terms of anything else.
Instead, you consider fundamental, and there's the world.
Sometimes, the list of how fundamental it is.
In the 19th century, Mahusel discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of terms of precise concepts, space, time, mass, Newton laws, so I put the basic laws of electronics, and put electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws govern.
I think that's the the situation that we found with consciousness.
If you can't explain awareness in terms of fundamental ideas, space, time, mass, load, then by logic, you have to get the list.
The most natural thing would be to put awareness itself as something fundamental, a fundamental brick of nature . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the way to handle scientifically.
So what we need is to study fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect awareness with other fundamental concepts: space, time, mass, physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can stand in a remix.
The situation of consciousness is something like this . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can set them into a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We still don't know what laws are, but that is what we look for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Each system can have a degree of consciousness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This vision sometimes is called pencillation:``Pan"by all,``psychiatric ,"for mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, mice, flies, even the microbes of Rob Knight, the elementary particles.
Even a photon has a degree of awareness.
The idea is not that photons are intelligent or thinking.
It's not that a photon can be full of distress when you think, ,, , speed.
I can never dismiss and smell the rose . ''
No ,.
But the thinking is that perhaps the photons can have some element of raw feeling, ,, ,, some primary precursor of consciousness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This can sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think such crazy?
So in part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental, , time and mass, is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth the idea that even though the idea seems illogical, it's much less for people in different cultures, where human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that relate to the physical process, is linking awareness with information.
So whenever there's information processing, there's awareness.
complex information processing, like a human being, complex awareness.
Simple information processing, simple consciousness . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, Giuliani Tony, took this kind of theory and development with mathematical methods . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is called a poem, which measures the degree of information embedded in a system.
And it has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In a mouse, there's a half a half of information integration, the same pretty significant, very important awareness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, , particle, the degree of that.
The level of information integration is less, but it's not zero either.
In Tonya theory, there will still be a different.
It actually provides a fundamental law of consciousness: high degree of point, high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that pencillation can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers often have noticed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't tell us about the reality that underlies.
As Stephen Hawking explained,``Where does the fire of equations come out? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
From the peaceful vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, ,, to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically, they describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the awareness is the one that puts fire in equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as sort of an additive species.
It's right right there.
This vision, I think, the peaceful vision, has the potential to transfer our relationship with nature, and it can have a pretty serious social and ethical implications.
Some can be illogical.
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be vegetarian.
If you're a politician and accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think I think about it, ,, this tends to transform your visions, whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral conservation, ,, ,, , but your complexity and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, computers.
What about the Samantha Artificial intelligence system in the``Hero"?
Is it conscious? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? . . .? . .? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
According to the vision of peaceful information, she has a complicated information processing, integrated, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If this is right, it's set up pretty serious ethical problems about developing intelligent computer systems and ethics.
And finally, you can ask for the complete collective awareness, the planet . ., . . ., . . . . . . . . . ., . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ., . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Does it have its own consciousness? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Or a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience in a TED Talk ., ,, ,, ,, , we have a TED collective awareness, an internal film for this whole group of TED, different of the internal movies in each one of the parts?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that should be serious.
So this peaceful view, it's a radical vision, , ,.
I'm actually safer of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, that the second one is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how do those pieces of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and we love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right way to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, ,, , is the hardest problem of science and of philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we would finally go to discover . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Understanding consciousness is the real key, ,, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria . Victoria . .
I had a, , a.
I went to school, I came together with my friends, I filmed my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15, , a member of my community came to my parents because I wanted to name for a community prize.
And my parents said,``Well, that's pretty nice, ,, a.
She actually hasn't gotten anything ."And they were right . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I went to school, I had good grades . After school, I had a low profile in my mother's lunch, and spent a lot of time looking at the``Bomb Slave"and``Damanci's Creek . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Yeah, I know it.
But they were right . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take disability outside the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of the teaching in a high school of Melanese, ,, just after about 20 minutes in class 11 minutes, a guy raised her hand and said,``Hey, when will you give your speech? ''
I said,``What's a speech? ''
Well, had been talking about the law law for about 20 minutes.
And he said,``You know, your motivation speech . . . .
When people in wheels, they talk about inspiration things in school? ''
\" Usually, in the acts room . ''
And it was when I realized,``This kid had had experiences with people with disabilities as objects of inspiration . ''
And we're not ., ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For us, people with disabilities are not our teachers or our doctors or our manifests.
We're not real people . We there to inspire.
And, in fact, I'm in this stage, looking what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you to inspire . Right? Yes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Well ladies and gentlemen, I, I'm afraid I'm going to tell you stranged.
I'm not here to inspire them.
I'm here to tell you that you have lied to disability.
Yes, they've sold us the lie that disability is something bad, ,, Machula.
It's something bad and living with a disability you make you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make it exceptional.
And in the last few years, we've been able to even more this lie through social communication media.
You may have seen images like this:``The only disability in life is a bad attitude . ''
Or this one,``Your excuse is invisible . ''
Or this:``Before I left, international! ''
These are just a couple examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may be you've seen one, with no hands drawing with a the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images that are what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the term that we're using deliberately, because they cost a group of people for the benefit of another group of.
So in this case, we are fascinated in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is to inspire them, motivate them, so that we can see them and think,``Well, for very bad that my life could be, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I could be that person . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But if you are that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that have been really bizarre to me, thinking that you believe that I am brave or an inspiration source, and this happened before my work had a public profile.
It was like I'm happy to get up in my morning and remember my own name . And this is to.
These images, those images cost people with disabilities in benefit of people without disability.
They are there so that you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective . . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns . concerns
And life as a disabled person is actually something hard.
We had some things.
But the things that we know is not things that you can think of.
They aren't relative things to our bodies.
I use the term``disabled people ,"deliberately because I'm supposed to call the social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabled because of society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited with him . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I do the things I need to do, and I've learned how to take the best of your ability as you do, and that's what happens with kids of those pictures too.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So, is it really fair to match them in how we do it, by sharing those images?
When people say to us,``You're an inspiration source ,"it says as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because we've sold this lie that disability makes us remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't.
And what you're thinking about.
So I'm doing the inspiration, and you think,``Oh God, star, are you not sometimes inspired by something? ''
And actually, I know I am.
I learn from other people with disabilities at all time.
But I won't learn that I'm more lucky than them.
I learned that it's a, to use a few blocks of balance to collecting the things that are falling in me, learning the ingenious trick of how to load the battery of the cell phone on the battery of the chair.
Great . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not not our our bodies and our diagnostics, but against a world that excited and we are cooperative.
I really think that that lies that have sold us about disability is the greatest.
It makes us hard life . . .
And that quote: ,``The only disability in life is a bad attitude ,"the reason that it's lie is that it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smile before a has never made it a ramp.
Never, smile at a television screen won't make the subtitles for people deaf.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and creating a positive attitude to convert all these books to the Brazilian.
It's not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching``Bomb Slave"is not no choice of anything to be in a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disabilities that we're happy to get out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a a, and I want to live in a world where a 11 degree in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprising that your new teacher is a user chair user.
Now, disability doesn't make us remarkable, but to question what you believe to know about how it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and professional football, with empathy?
And what is the average speed of a glucose without charge?
Unfortunately, today, I just respond to one of those questions, so please don't melt.
When people think of augmented reality, he thinks about``Minority Report"and in Tom Cruise, driving hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
The augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the augmented reality?
The first step, it's what I'm wearing: Google Glass glasses.
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google Glass are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what is a professional sport in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I'm trying to describe them.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what it is to run through the game field to 160 miles, the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds will allow us, trying to be able to do with everything.
I've been there and I assure you it's nothing nice.
I bring some videos to show you what the Google Glass is under the helmet, and give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they are not images of the NFL practices, because the idea of the fundamental technology of technology is a submarine coming up to surface . But, we can do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris Kelly: Come.
It's horrible to being tangible.
A moment . Let as a little bit.
Ready?
Go!
Chris Juliet: : As you can see, it's a proof of what's being used in the football field, from the performance perspective.
You may have noticed that you lack people, ,.
We have a video of them, the University of Washington University.
field Maryland: mice 54! mice! . mice!.
Blue 8, blue eight!! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Chris Juliet: : I'm about a little bit more of the, but it has nothing to do with being at at.
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be their favorite players, and they asked me on YouTube and Twitter,``You can see from the angle of a field machine.
It's a corridor? ''
We want to experience that . ''
Once we have that experience with God and Google Glass, how do we get out of fill, how do the next level?
We took it to that level using something called Occupy Rich, , ,.
The Occupy Rift has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, , and it's not cheap.
I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh ,! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
No, no, no! I don't playing playing! No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
CK: : That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain, and it's going on by his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we do a video of Adrianne Peter crossing the line, ,, dropping out of an arm with the before running and making an analysis? experience . experience . experience . experience . experience . experience . experience . experience . experience . experience . experience . experience . experience . experience . experience . experience . experience.
When can I be Messan running out of the board, launching the ball at the bottom of the web?, or did a ship in Wikipedia??????????????????????????????????????????
What will your experience to be when you get a mountain to over 100 miles as an Olympic skier?
Maybe you increase the sales of adults for adults.
But this is not even augmented.
It's just virtual reality ,.
How do we achieve augmented reality, right?
We'll achieve reality when the coaches, the machines and the owners see the information of what people want to see and think,``How do we use this to improve our teams?
How do we use it to win parties? ''
Because they always use technology to win.
They like win . It gives you money.
So, here's a brief shot about technology at NFL.
In 1965, Baltimore dishes put a mess to their field of field to the field to play faster.
They won Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to imitate them . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
More people saw the because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the CO2 put radios into the slums of the camps, and then in the defenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In 2013, , imagine that you're a player coming back to your group and you see their next play shown in front of you, in a plastic visit that you're wearing, ,, ,, , you won't have to worry about forgetting a game . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Or to memorize strategy.
They just come out to the, and react.
And the coaches want it, because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate losing parties.
If you lose parties you wake up as a coach coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual strategy manual.
augmented reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game to play the game.
How would it be?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the cars and the heart sensors, something that's already working.
And all that information is sent to your players.
Good teams will know.
The bad ones will have an information overload.
This difference the good teams of bad.
So your computer team will be as important as your scouts, and data analysis will stop being just for nerds.
So who would have imagined it?
How would it be in the field?
Imagine that you are a field machine.
You get the the ball and backwards.
You look for an open receptor . All of a sudden, a flashlight on the left part of your visit, that a defense in the left of your visit is going to attack you . Normally, you don't see it, but the RS system would warn you.
You advance the protection area.
Another fly prevents you there is an open receptor.
You launch the button.
And the bullet loses the trajectory . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You don't know where to land . However, the receiver sees an area of grass that lights and can modify race.
It goes up, catches the ball, running and analog.
The public calculation and the fans have followed the play from every angle.
This is something that will create massive emotion in the party.
I'll make lots of people to see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player . .
The augmented reality will be part of sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, ,, is we want this to be the only use of augmented reality?
Are we going to use it just like bread and circus, like our habitual entertainment?
Because I think we can use it for more.
I think we can use the augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is literally in someone else's place.
We know what this technology is worth for sports league.
It creates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show an abuse how harmful their actions are from the victims of?
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world, how does it live?
How much is it for a Chinese Cataloscope or a Deneter degree Toolocute trying to inspire a generation of children to to think more in space and science instead of thermal notes and Karajan?? . .
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality goes on.
The questions we do, the decisions that we take and the challenges that we face face face, they depend, as usual.
Thank you.
I recently retire me after 23 years of service in the Hihardown City of California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California . California.
Most of that 23 years, I spent the paradigm of the south County of Marine County, which includes the Golden Gate Bridge . .
The bridge is an iconic structure, known globally by their beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean, and his inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Goldman Gate Bridge was open in 1973 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Joseph Strauss, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The suicide from the bridge is not practical or practice . . . ''
But from their openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of you believe that traveling between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has been identified as such, such that each one from it is released from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that are under your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body crashed against 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bones, ,, some of which you do.
Most die in impact.
The ones who don't, usually get stuck in the helpless water and then they drowned.
I don't think those of you who control this method of suicide will realize the death of death that will be faced . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is the wire.
Except about two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel.
Here is where most people are going to take away from life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is at on that edge, and at the darker time, it's very hard to back.
I took this picture last year as this young man talked with an office contemplating his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we succeeded that day to bring it back on the board.
When I started working on the, we had no formal training.
We fought to channel the way through these calls . . . .
This wasn't just a to those who are contemplating suicide, but the officials also.
We've traveled a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train new officials.
This is Jason Gardner.
I met it at 22 of July last year when you get a call of a possible suicide subject sitting in the heart near center.
I replied, and when I came, ,, ,, I looked at an official of the Bridge Gates.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times before New Jersey, to try to suicide from this bridge . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And after about an hour talking to Jason, we asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box.
By remembering the Greek mythology, Beau created Pandora, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Well, one day, curiosity could more than Pandora, and she opened the box.
It came out pests, sorrows, and all kinds of bad against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us,``What if you open the box and there's no hope hope hope? ''
It stopped a few instincts, it turned on the right, and it was.
This nice and intelligent guy in New Jersey just removed life.
I talked to Jason's parents that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, itn't seemed to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how I was.
Jason's parents had been asked . . . . . . . . . . . . .
collateral damage of suicide affect many people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a or someone loved suicide?
What would you say?
Would you know what to say?
In my experience, not just to talk, but you have to hear.
Listening to understand.
Don't argue, blame, or say to the person who know how it feels, because you don't probably know it.
It's just going to be there, you can be the point of inflection they need.
If you think somebody's suicide, you're not afraid to face and ask the question.
A way to ask them the question is,``Other in similar circumstances have thought about finishing your life; ,? ''
confrontation person in front can save life and be the point of inflection for them.
Other signs to look for: despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to improve; impotence, believe that there's nothing you can do about it, the recent social isolation, and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email of a lady and I'd like to read you his card . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
She lost his son in January 19 of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it his permission and that he read.
\" Hi, Kevin . I think you're at on the TED conference.
It must be an experience to be there.
I'm thinking I should go foot into the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell her friends, etc.
I'm still pretty excited about it, ,, but I'm going to notice more moments to realize that Mike won't come home.
Mike was driving from Peter to San Francisco to to see the 40 with her father's 19.
It never came there.
So I called Peter's police, and I reported it as desperation that night . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The next morning, two officials came to my house and reported me that Mike's car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge at 1.5 of the late day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who may be too weak to fight them.
Who hasn't been before bad without suffering a truly mental illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?? illness?
It should not be so easy with it.
My prayers are with you.
The GMT, Gates is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cemeteries.
Good luck this week, Victoria . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and, to the, his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 , 2005, , I responded to a radio call by a possible subject in the sidewalk near the northern tower.
I drove my motor on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin Berkeley, standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, , he was immediately crossing the barrier, and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and half, I heard like Kevin talked about its depression and despair.
Kevin decided to decide that day to come back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, the happy.
This is a new beginning, a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But I asked him,``What did you get back and give hope hope and life another opportunity? ''
And you know what he said?
He said ,.
You let me talk and just heard . ''
Shortly after that incident, ,, I got a letter from Kevin's mother, and I have that card with me, and I'd like to leave you.
\" Dear Lord Brits ,"Nothing will erase the events of the 11, and you are one of the reasons that Kevin is following us.
So, I think Kevin was changing for help.
It has been diagnosed with a mental illness that has been properly measured.
I adopted Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious from all those of those CEOs, but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, as he says . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We give it thank God for you.
It's honestly in debt with you, nature Bertrand . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And at the end, she wrote,``Well, ,, . When I visited the General hospital of San Francisco that night, you signed as the patient.
\" Come that I had to solve! ''
Today, Kevin is a loving father and active member of society . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He speaks openly about the events of that day and of his depression to hope that his story inspired others.
The suicide is not just something I've ever found on work.
It's personal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
My grandfather's suicide.
That act, despite finishing their own pain, ,, is the opportunity to know it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is what the suicide does.
For most of the suicide people, or those who consider suicide, don't think about paying another person.
They just want your own pain to end.
And usually, this is only only only three ways: sleeping, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental diseases and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved in, I, ,, , but those two are too . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
One was Jason . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
During that time, I shook my hand in three times.
In the final end, he looked at me, and he said,``Kevin, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And they went out . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Awful, absolutely awful . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I want to tell you, though, the vast majority of the people we get to contact on that bridge is not suicide.
Also, those these few people who have jumped out of the bridge and living and you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that they left from side, was realized that they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I say to people, the don't just connect Mars with San Francisco, , people . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each one of us should be to do.
suicide can be prevented.
There's help . There's hope . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Thank you.
The world makes you be what you're not, but in your inner, you know what you are, and a question makes you ask yourself, how do you become that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in no.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream I had ever since.
My foreign finally confident with my inner truth, with me inside.
For complicated reasons, I I'm going to say to me later, when I look at this picture, I think you do it.
But last October, I, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We all get rid of our families, our religion, , our society, our moment in history, , . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . ., . . ,.
Some of you have the value of releasing, to get rid of the constraints of the skin color, or by the beliefs of around us.
They are people who always defy the status, which is considered accepted.
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this animal is called reveal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is mine.
They recorded me as``child"because of the appearance of my genitals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I, I always had this t-shirt.
And my mom asks me,``Why do you always take that shirt in your head? ''
I said,``Mom, it's my hair . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I knew how to select.
The gender has always considered an unchanging fact, but now we know that, actually, it something more complex and mysterious.
Because of my success, , I never dare to share my story, not because I think to be what I'm bad, but how the world is treating those of us who want to liberate.
Every day, I appreciate a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who accepted me as me.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in Asia culture that celebrated the mystery of gender . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion . . . . . . . . . .
There's an Indian god, ,.
And when I was eight, I was at a party in The Philippines that these mysteries celebrated.
I was in front of the stage and remember that this beautiful woman came up with me, and I remember that moment as if something will beat me: This is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15, , when I still saw this woman called TED.
It's a principal beauty competition.
That night she said,``Why don't you participate in the beauty competition? ''
He told me that if she participated her, he would get out of inspiration spending and of the, and that night, he won in bathroom suits, won in chicken suit and left third between 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
All of a sudden, I was within the world of beauty queens.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was of beauty of beauty of bridge women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of unemployment, especially when we traveled to the Prime Philippines . . . . . . . . . .
But more importantly, I met my best friends of that community.
In the 2001, my mom who had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me, told me that they were approved to my green card that I could go to live in the United States.
I was resistant . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I said to my mother,``Mommy, I . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I'm here with friends, I like traveling and being a Queen of beauty . ''
But then two weeks later, he called me and said,``You know if you moved to the United States, you can change the name and gender identity? ''
It was everything I needed.
My mom suggested that I put two``and"to my name.
She also passes me when I was operating in Thailand at 19.
It's curious that in some of Thailand's most rural cities in Thailand make the surgery more prestigious, sophisticated and safe.
At the time in the United States, it was necessary to make surgery before we change the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the General name and the``F"of female gender . . gender . .
It was a great time . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For some people, their identity documents means being able to drive or be able to get a short, but for me, to living, to feel worthy.
Soon, my fears were constrained.
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman from the New York.
A young woman in New York who normally lived his truth, but, described, he put his life back.
For many of my community, that is the reality.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the the rest of the population.
All 20 of November, we make a global video game for the Conference Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who fight and stood in injustice.
These are Marsha J. Johnson and Sylvia Rivan.
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth, just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, exposing, so that some day there is no longer victims in November 20.
My deepest truth led me to accept what I . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Will you do it??? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you . Kathryn Schulz: Yeah, , a . . .
George Rockwell: :, ., . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
My support network, my parents especially, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've spent young women, that I've experienced, and sometimes, when they call me and tell me that his parents couldn't accept it . I took the phone, called my mom and said,``Mommy, can you call this woman? ''
Sometimes it works, others not . It's just identity of gender, that is what is in the center of what we are, right?
That is, we're all assigned to be assigned by birth, and what I try to do is to put the on the table that some times doesn't figure out, and there should be a space that allowed people to engage, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The transition movement is starting compared to gay motion . . . .
There's still a lot of work to do . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It should be understanding . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There should be space for curiosity to ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you . Very nice . Green: Thank you.
In many patriarchal and tribal societies, parents usually meet them for their children, but I'm one of a few parents who know about their daughter, and I'm proud of it.
Malaysia started his campaign by defending his rights in 2007, , and when their efforts in 2011, when their efforts was honored in 2011, he became very famous, a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but I'm now his father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Ladies and gentlemen, if we look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the history of injustice, of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in patriarchal societies, right from the beginning, when a girl's born, his birth is not celebrated.
It's not no welcome, no for your father, not your mother.
The neighborhood comes, day their condoms to mother and nobody happy the father.
And a mother gets overwhelmed for having a girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
When you give light to the second daughter, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Not only is the mother suffer, but the daughter, the newborn daughter, when he grows up, he's suffering.
At the age of five, when I should go to school, it stays home and school admit to her siblings.
Until 12, in a way, it has a good life.
You can fun.
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move around the streets like a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But when it comes into adolescence, when it's 13 years old, it's proven to go out of her house without a male machine . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's confined at four walls of your house.
It's no longer a free person . . . . . . . . .
It becomes the honor of his father, and his siblings and his family, and if he translated the code of that honest, he could even kill it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And it's interesting that this kind of honor code, not only affect a, also affects the life of male members of family.
So this brother, he sacrifice the joys of his life and happiness of his sisters in names of the honor.
And there's an norm more of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience.
It's supposed a good girl must be very quiet, very humble and very smooth.
It's criteria.
The model of a good girl must be.
It's supposed to be silent, and it accepts the decisions of your father and your mother and the decisions of the elderly, even if you don't want.
If you marry it with a man who don't like or if you marry it with an old man, it has to accept it, , because it doesn't want to be being useful.
If you're very young, you have to accept it.
Otherwise, they will call it unbalanced.
And what at the end?
In the words of a poet,``The house, ,, ,, , ,"and then it gives birth to more children and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, he included the same birth of of his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
Dear brothers and sisters, when Malaysia was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to being honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely honored.
And a lot before I was born, ,, ,, ,, ,, and it was fascinated with a legendary struggle of in Afghanistan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
His name was Malaysia, and he called my daughter like this.
But when I looked, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and swallowed a line of my name, and I wrote,``Bad . ''
And when she grew up, when she was four and a half and a half, I school.
You'll ask, why should I mention a girl's admission in a school?
Yeah, to.
You can give it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies, is a great activity for child life.
Interracculated in a school means the recognition of their identity and of his name . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
An admission to school means it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I've got five sisters, and no one of them could go to school, and they would be surprised, two weeks earlier, when I was blown up the Canadian version of, and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the qualities of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in no document.
That was why I value my daughter.
What my father could give my sisters or his daughters, I thought he had to change it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the sanctity of my daughter.
I was encouraged to sit with me when my friends came to me.
I'll go with me at different meetings.
And all of these values, , I've tried to lock them into his personality . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And this wasn't just for it, , just for Malaysia . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I've permeated all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for emotion.
Teach my daughters, teach students, to forget the lesson of the obedience.
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called Secretary.
Dear brothers and sisters, we fought for more rights for women, and we fought to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called Taliban.
That means a complete denial from women's participation in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools lost.
Girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use veil and stopped going to markets.
The musicians were silenced, the young girls and killed singers.
They suffer millions, but they were just talked, and it was frightening to have around those people who kill and satisfied when you talk about your rights.
It's really frightening . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
By the 10 years, Malaysia got up and lifted up to education . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He wrote a newspaper for the blog of the BBC, he was offered himself for the New York Times documentary, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It's spreading as a camera around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and nine of October 2012, they shot burning on his head . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It was a factory for my family and my family.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was debating between life and death, ,, , I whispered my wife, ,, ,, , ,? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .?.
And she said,``Please don't blame you.
It destroys the fair cause.
You put your life in play for the cause of the cause of the, for the cause of peace, and the cause of education, and your daughter inspired yourself and joined you.
Both of them were in the right way and God will protect him . ''
These few words meant a lot for me, and I didn't ask again . . . . . .
When Malaysia was in the hospital and had severe pains and strong headaches, because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that goes through the face of my wife.
But my daughter never complained.
I used to say,``I'm fine with my awkward smile and in my face.
I'll get good . Please don't worry . ''
It was a challenge for us, , and we . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Dear brothers and sisters, we've learned from it how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm pleased pleased share with you that despite being an icon for children's rights and women, it's like any 16 year-old girl.
It's crying when you don't end up.
It fights their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me,``What's special in my tutor that has made so bold to Malaysia so, expressive and equality? ''
I tell you, I don't wonder what I did.
Ask me what I didn't do.
It doesn't cut their wings and that is all.
Thank you.
Thank you . Thank you very much . Thanks.
I was operated from the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the brain science has become a personal passion.
I am engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined me to the Mountain group, where I've had a, , the visible of Google X visualization, but all the work that I'll talk about today about the science of the brain, did before join Google or outside my work there.
Now, I said this, there's a stigma when you get to an operation of brains . . . . . . . . . . .
You keep being just as smart or not?
If not that, can you be intelligent?
After the neurogenesis, ,, ,, ,, ,, and had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, ,, ,, ,, but it was the sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and neurotransmitters.
And immediately after the operation, I, I had to decide how much to to, ,, , from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Every day, for the last 18 years, ,, ,, I've had to decide about combinations and mixture of chemicals, and trying to get them to keep life.
More than one time I've saved myself.
But luckily, ,, I have an experimental soul, so I decided that I would experience to try to get the the the optimal dose, because there's really no clear map that I'm going to say to in detail.
I started testing a different mix, and I was surprised by seeing how small changes in doses changed dramatically my autonomy, my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly impressive case: for a few months, I tried doses and typical chemicals for a, and I was surprised by seeing how my thoughts changed.
I was always furious, ,, ,, sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and -- of course, many times in the past, I've met several types like this, or perhaps some of the versions.
It turned out as an extreme . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be arrogant.
In fact, I was trying, a lot of insecure, fixing a problem that was in front, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't do it.
I changed my doses.
But, I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what you have to go through.
What I was trying to achieve, when we adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, was to reclaim my intelligence after the disease and the operation, my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
And I tend to think about almost always in images, and that became my key reference point: how do I get those mental images that I use to create prototyping, my ideas, if you want?, and recreating situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
philosophers like Homer, ,, Descartes and Hobbes see things similar.
They thought images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Now, there are people who questioned this idea, and there's a lot of arguments about how the mind works . It is simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental for creative and invention thinking.
So after several years, I managed to find the point right, and I have lots of great mental, really software and well strengthened.
Now, I'm working on how to take good, these mental images, of my mind to the screen screen.
Can you imagine what if a movie director was able to use your imagination just to address the world that's going to be in front?
Or if a could extract your head music?.
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments made by two recent groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, image for functional magnetic resonance, to represent the brain . Here you can see the brain scan made by George winning and their Harvard colleagues . . .
The column on the left shows the skull of of a person who looks at an image.
The middle column shows the skull of the brain of that same individual as you imagine, seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created by running the contents of the central column of the on the left . You see that the difference is almost zero-sum.
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost zero-sum.
Now let me share another experiment . This is Jack Galleta's lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to convert brain waves into responsive visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of YouTube videos while they were typing their brains to creating a, brain reaction in video sequences . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Then, you've got a film with new images, new people, new animals, and while you would record a new scan.
The computer, using the brain information of the scan, decided to show what seemed that the person was seeing.
On the right, you can see the computer leaders, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us background.
We're good at doing it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember that when you see an image, and when you imagine that same image, you create the same mapping.
This led to Cape with the largest resolution systems of available resolution today, and their resolution was increased as a in the last years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we achieve it?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening the skull and introduced electrodes.
I don't offer for that.
Many are proposing new projections of projection for images, even me, by telling the recent result of MRI, first we have to ask ourselves the following, this technology will be the end of the?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get more resolution is with larger magnets, but to this point, more grain magnets only offer small improvements in resolution, , we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets, we make better magnets.
We can create structures much more complex with slightly different arrangements, like doing a spread.
And why does that care???
In the last few years, a in the MRI was to make really big images, right?
However, most of the recent breakthroughs in reconstruction of resourceful and brilliant solutions in coding and decoding, in the transportations and the reverse radio frequency in MRI.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field, we use magnificent magnetic patterns attached to the FM radio frequencies.
So, when you combine magnetic patterns with the patterns of the processing processing of the FM radio frequency, we can increase the information that you can extract in a single scan.
Moreover, we can then divide in layers our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using MRI, we should be able to measure not only the fluid blood of blood blood, but the in the hormones and neurotransmitters that I've mentioned and perhaps even direct neural activity . This is the sleep . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We will be able to fly our ideas in a direct way to digital media . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Can you imagine if we could go through language and communicate directly through thinking?
What would we be capable of?
And how do learning how to deal with the truths of human thinking without filter?
You thought the Internet is something big.
These are big questions . . .
It would be irresistible to use it as tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's cure and similar diseases.
We have a few more choices to open this door.
Anyway, choose one year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to to take a lot more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, not a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have branches.
Your closet is maybe to to a person for the first time you love or tell someone who is pregnant, or to tell someone who has cancer, ,, ,, in life.
All closet is a hard conversation, and even though our themes can tremendous, the experience of living and have come out of that closet is universal.
Give fear, and we don't like, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working at the South Side Wall Collar, ,, , a restaurant in the city, and being there, I, I had to go through several phases of the intelligent military intensity: I wouldn't break my armpits, , to quote the letters of Ann Di France as a . . . . . . . . . .
And I'm going to be pending that by the Holocaust of my short pants and in my mind, I did a little bit of my mind, and I would ask me a little bit,``Hey, are you a kid or girl? ''
And there's an awkward silence on the table.
I'd add my jaw a a, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The father would kindly the newspaper, and the mother would launch a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I would get to get it inside.
And then I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, ready to fight.
And that's a . . .
So I promise that next time I would say something.
It would have that hard conversation . . .
So after a few weeks, again.
\" Are you a kid or a girl? .????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
A familiar silence, but this time was prepared and was about to get in full of the in the female issues on the table . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Gloria Steinem dates . . .
Even a fragment of the``Vagina Monologues"to show.
So I'd breathe, and I went down the gaze and I went down a four-year-old girl with a pink dress, looking at what's not a challenge for a feminist leader, just a girl with a question,``Are you a kid or girl? ''
So I breathe again, I put knives close to it, and I said,``Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like the one of a kid, and I saw a kid clothing, but I'm a girl, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a, ,, ,.
Well, , I'm more than a child's girl . ''
And that girl looked at me, paying attention, and he said,``My favorite pajamas is violent and has a fish.
Can you give me a paintbrush, please? ''
And that was all . Just``Ah, OK . You're a girl.
What about the ring I asked? ''
It was the easiest that I've ever had.
And why? Because the girl of the ring and I, both, we, we were honest with one another.
So like many of us, I've lived in some of, in my life, and I know, my walls used to be to be.
But within the darkness, you can't know what color is.
You just know how one feels living in an closet . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
That's how my closet is not different than yours or yours or yours.
And surely, I'll give you 100 reasons why to go out of my closet, it was tougher than coming out of, but this is the: The hard is not relative.
It's hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who have been declared in rock bank is harder to say that it has been fooled?
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder to tell your five-year-old son?
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard thing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We have to stop rating what is hard to what is hard to make us feel better or worse in relationship to our, and we must just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some in our lives, we all live in closet, and they may feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you, that no matter what their walls are like, an closet is not a place to live.
Thank you . Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and a high heels.
It wasn't the the military lesbian prepared to fight any four years of four to enter the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, curled up in a corner of my dark closet by spreading my gay grenade, and moving only a muscle is the most frightening thing I ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever have ever ever
My family, my friends, complete strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to not disappoint them, and now the world was turned around.
I was burning the pages of a guide that we've all been followed for so long, but if you don't launch that grenade, will kill you.
One of my most memorable landscape was in my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that many among the guests knew that it was gay, and by doing my honor ladies, in my black dress and tapestries, I walked around the tables, and finally I got to one where my parents' friends, people who knew me was for years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women screamed,``I love Nathan Mandela! ''
And the gay story battle had started.
\" Are you in the Castro? ''
\" Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San Francisco . ''
\" Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's fabulous . ''
\" Assan, ,"Assaula?
It's very good, and it has never talked about having bride . ''
\" Asset, for your favorite TV program?
Our favorite program? Will and Grace.
And you know who love us? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Jack is our favorite . ''
And then a woman, unfortunately, ,, ,, ,, ,, in waiting to desperately show his support, to make me know that I was on my side, finally said,``Well, sometimes my husband uses pink shirt . ''
And I had an opportunity at that time, ,, as you've got all of the grenade launchers.
Now, surely, it could have been easy to indicate where they felt known.
It's not not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were operating.
And what else can you ask, but do you hope?
If you're going to be authentic with someone, ,, you've got to be prepared for how authentic you get.
That's how difficult conversations remain without being my strong point.
Ask anyone to come out with.
But I'm improving, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Pacific girl.
Now, please you see this through gay perspective, but you understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
Take the armor . Be yourself.
That girl in coffee had no armor, but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to genuine, others should know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be direct . . . . . .
If you know it's gay, tell you.
If they say their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important -- leave complex.
You communicate its truth . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's never apologize for that.
And some of you can be wounded safe, sorry for what you've done, ,, . .
And yes, maybe some of you will feel disappointed, but something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the history of them.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So next time you meet in a dark dark, you have to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Thanks, Boulder . Enjoy the veil.
So intelligence, what is that? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And if you look at the story of how intelligence has seen, a productive example has been the famous quote from Edinburgh Dickens that``The question of if a machine can think of it is as interesting as whether a can swim . . . ''
When Edmund Dickens wrote this, he did this as a criticism to the pioneers of computing as Alan Turing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And so a few years ago, I started a program to try to understand the underlying physical physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you are from an alien race, which you do don't know anything about the biology of Earth or neuroscience from Earth or intelligence of Earth, but you have incredible telescopes and can see Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect . . .
Of course, as terrorists, we know that reason we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which has no concept about the Earth intelligence, you would be compelled to develop a physical theory that will explain how, ,, ,, ,, to the surface of a planetary planet stop doing it.
And so I just claim that this is the same question that to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I did several years ago, I analyzed a variety of topics through science, through several disciplines, that they were, I think, to a, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In cosmology, for instance, there's been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be really failed for development of intelligence, and in particular, for development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible future.
And finally, in the robotic movement planning, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different themes and putting them together, ,, ,, ,, I said,``Is there a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different themes? ''
Is there just an equation for intelligence??.
And I think the answer is . What you're seeing is probably the most close equivalent to one E = for the intelligence I've seen.
So what you're seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is a, ,, that acts to to to maximize the freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the freedom of action, or keeping the open choices, ,, ,, ,, with the diversity of possible future future, yes, to an impending future, taboo.
In a few words, intelligence doesn't like to be caught.
The intelligence is trying to maximize the freedom of action and keep the open choices.
And so, having to tell this equation, it it's natural to question: ,? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
How predictive is it?? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? .? . . .? . . . . .? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Is it the level of human intelligence?
Are artificial intelligence?
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: Right research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more clutter, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, of intelligent creatures like us . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But what if that kind of cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence a deeper relationship?
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlated with the production of the long-term entropy, but actually it directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called Atmastery, designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where it is within.
Surprisingly, entropy could spend multiple tests of animal intelligence, play human games, ,, ,, and even make money eating actions, , would have been told to do that . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Here are some examples of Entertainment in action.
Like a human foot human falling, here we see entropy balancing automatically a post using a cart.
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave entropy a goal.
He simply decided to balance the post.
This ability of balance will have applications for human robotics and human aid technologies.
This ability of tools use will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing . manufacturing.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate by taking extreme opposite opposite of a rope at the same time to liberate food, here we see that entropy can perform a a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in other fields.
entropy is widely applicable to a variety of domain.
For instance, here we see it successfully playing a poker game against itself, poster for play.
So here we see entropy to organize new connections in a social network where friends are constantly disconnected and successfully maintain the connected net.
This same capacity of network orchestras also has applications in health care, and intelligence . . care . .
Here we see entropy to organize the routes of a ship fleet, discovering success and using the Panama Canal to expanding the global level from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, entropy is widely applicable to problems in autonomous, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see entropy spontaneously to discover and run a strategy of behavior, window in a simulated negotiation of action, successfully increasing the assets under their management exponentially . .
This possibility of risk management will have broad and safe applications.
Alex Birts: :: What you've seen is that a variety of intelligent human behavior behaviors like the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all of a single equation, which leads to a system to maximize their freedom of action.
Now here's a deep irony.
So we went back at the beginning of the use of the robot term, the word``ROV"-- there was always the concept that if we developed intelligent machines, there would be a cyber rebellion.
The machines will get up against us.
So one of the biggest implications of this work is that perhaps all of these decades, we've had all of the the concept of cyber rebellion to reverse.
It's not that machines first become intelligent and then megamentals and they're trying to be able to get in the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse of taking control of all future power is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control, rather than being the backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of objective.
I often ask you,``How is it looking for goals from this kind of framework?????????????????????????????????????????????????????
My equivalent to that statement to go back to the descendants to help them build artificial intelligence or to help them understand the human intelligence, is the following: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the freedom of action and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you.
We are in an inflection point in human history, something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet we call home``home . ''
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how Earth is in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Keller of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets that orbit around other stars, which points that the Earth is only one between billions of planets in our galaxy . . . . . . .
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the limiting intensity of the stars when planets go through them, and blocking a, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The data collected by Kepler shows the size of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their mother star.
In conjunction, this helps us understand if these planets are small and rocky as the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their sun.
At the time, this gives clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not not.
Unfortunately, as we're finding this treasure of potentially habitable worlds, , our own planet is running under the weight of humanity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
2014 was the hottest recorded.
glaciers and sea ice that have been with us from millions now are disappearing in decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused globally, has rapidly overcome our ability to alter their course.
But I am not a scientist of the weather, or a station . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But I study the ability of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I look for alien opportunities in the embryonic sector.
Now, as someone very interested in life search in the universe, I can tell you that the more I look for planets like Earth, more enjoying our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invited a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know better: the of our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and rock, and despite being a little further from the sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world shown this by a like Kepler . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and, in part, is why we studied Mars so much.
Our Rovers like``Curiosity"trace its surface in search for clues on the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that orbiting it, like the MIT mission, take samples from the Martian atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their ability.
private companies now provide not just short space flights, but also the ability to live on Mars.
But even though all these Martian images remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with caring ideas and pioneers, compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
We take the extension of the desert areas of our planet who still remain to colonization, really excited places compared to Mars . . comparison . . comparison . .
Even in the more dry and elevated places of the Earth, the air is fresh and full of oxygen that our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will get a big, sad shadow: the imagination and belief of some of some of some that Mars will wait for us to save us from this influenced self-assembly of the only planet that we know is truly habitable, Earth.
And so much that I like exploration, I deep with this idea.
There are many good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to save humanity is like imagining that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party of truth will be more late in the wild boats . Thank you.
But the goals for intellectual exploration and land preservation is not contradictions.
No, they are actually face of the same coin: , to understanding, preserving and improving life in the future . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We have extreme environments present in our world.
They're just getting closer to home . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces, in the hostile and inhibiting areas of the Earth, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a mental experiment: the paradox of Fermi.
A lot of years ago, the British physicist Fermi asked, ,, ,, , has been in mind that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of alien life.
Well where are they?
Well, , a solution to Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become extremely advanced enough to continue to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of planets that improvised this development.
It's arrogant to think that just intellectual colonization will save us from ourselves, but planetary pressure and intellectual exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our in our to support the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, ,, , we should be able to overcome the even easier task to preserve the ability on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, my own home.
And while I was in the front porch, looking in my pockets, I I I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window they were at the at the at the dining table, where he had left them.
So quickly, I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all right closed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I thought about calling a coral, at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a could take a long time to get, and cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to to spend night, because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I was practicing my passport and my suitcase.
It would be expensive, but sure that it's not more expensive than a, night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, , I went well stopped . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I'm a professional neuroscientist, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress . .
Contentious release that increases heart rate, morality levels and color thinking.
And when I came to the in the in the in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, , I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started wondering, if there was something I could do, systems that could put in its place, that they avoid bad things.
Or at least, when bad things happen, they minimize the probability that it is a total catastrophe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So I got to think about that, but until one month after my thoughts thoughts.
I was dinner with my colleague Danny Kahn won from the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed told him that he broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called prospective retrospective.
It's something he had learned from psychologist Gary Klein, who had written about this a few years earlier, known as the printer.
You all know what the dessert is.
Every time there's a disaster, a comes and tries to figure out what came wrong, ,? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the, like Danny, like Danny, you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you could get wrong, next, try to figure out what you can do to prevent things to happen or to minimize damage.
So what I want to talk to you about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Some of them are evidence, . They are not so obvious . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, to a place for the things that are easily lost.
This sounds common, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this thesis, based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of the important things, where the good, where the fish are, that underlies fruit trees, where friends are living and enemies.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that falls into London's taxis.
It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts.
And if you ask yourself if someone really did the experiment, they cut up the solid sense of the squirrels, and yet they could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism from the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that are moving a lot.
This is why to lose car keys, reading glasses and passports.
So at home, it's a place for keys, a hook to the door, maybe a decorative dish.
For his passport, , a . . .
For their reading glasses, a.
If you get a place and you're exploded with it, your things will always be there when you search them.
What about trips?
They take the cell phone a picture of their credit card cards, driving, passion, send them by mail to be in the cloud.
If these things lose or steal, this can facilitate sustainability.
These are some of the obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, , the corporate brain.
The cortisol is toxic and entertainment.
So part of the premise practice is to recognize that under stress is not going to be in the better, and you have to put the systems on your place.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're faced with medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a dear to help them to help them a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And so I want to talk about that.
And talk about a very particular medical infection.
But this is a protection for a protocell for a lot of medical decisions, and in fact for financial decision-making and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take from a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor, and the doctor says,``I've received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little high . ''
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with greater risk of cardiovascular diseases, attacks to heart, stroke.
So you're thinking that having the high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says,``I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the cholesterol, a statue . ''
And maybe you've heard about the states, and you know it's one of the most recycled drugs in the world today . It's probably likely to know people who take them.
So you think,``Yeah, it's a record . ''
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistics that you should ask that most doctors don't want to talk about, and pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the, the number needs to treat.
And what is this, , the RNA?
It's the number of people who should take a drug medication or to to a surgery in any medical procedure before it helps to a person . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And should you think about what kind of described statistics is that?.
The number must be.
My doctor wouldn't tell me anything if it not to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor's fault, and if it's somebody's fault, it scientists like me.
We've never understood underlying mechanisms.
But the statistics of Gladius that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 percent of people.
So the number need to treat the the most widely recipes, which you think it is?
How many people have to take it before it helps a person??
300 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This according to the research of cynical researchers, Jeremy Group and Pamela Harbor, confirmed independently by Burnian.
I'm exploring the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke or another adverse event.
Now maybe you think,``Well, one probability in 300 of leaving my cholesterol.
Why not, doctor? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But then you have to ask for a statistics more, and it is,``Tell me of the side effects ."Yeah?
For this particular drug, the secondary effects are produced in five percent of patients.
And those include terrible things: ballowing muscle, massive pain, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , but now you think,``Five percent isn't very likely that I, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But a moment.
Remember, you don't think clearly.
So think about how to look at this over time, so they don't have to make the chain of the in the act.
300 people take the drug, not? A person has helped, five percent of the 300 have side effects, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get through the drug that is helping you.
I don't mean they should or not to take the statue.
I just say they must have this conversation with their doctor.
Medical ethics requires it, is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not no . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You might be thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value value, but actually this number needs to treat is pretty typical.
For the surgery that is more in the more of 50, the extraction of the cancer prostate, the number need to 40.
So , 49 surgeries for a person who has helped.
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of patients . .
Those include the impact or fundamental dysfunction, the uranium incident, right lake, the fecal discomfort.
And if you're lucky and it's one of that 50 percent, you would just last one year or two.
So the idea of the premise is to think before time the questions that you can plant to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to build all this in the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have an option many times, you want a shorter life, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things you talk about and think about now, with your family and your loved ones.
They can change opinion in the heat of time, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our body release brain under stress, and one of the things that happens at that time is that a lot of systems are off.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a predator, it's not necessary for the digestive system, or the release or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react to fast . They could be the to be the lunch of lions, so none of that matters . . . . . . . . . . .
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through window during those moments of stress is rational thinking, like Danny Kahn and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to train to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize we are all flawed.
We're all going to fail.
The idea is to think about the future, how could those failures be, to putting the systems in the place that will help you minimize damage, ,, to prevent that bad things happen in the first place . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Now, rebuilding at night in Montreal, when I came back from my journey, my contractor shows me a combination cart in a door, with a key door in the same, an easy way to remember.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered, and many of mail I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see organization as a gradual process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you.
Interpreter: piano,``P"is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing softly.
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a``P"in the score, you need to touch more gently.
Two' P, even healthier.
Four . .
This is my drawing of a tree tree, and this is that you see it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of them, you may never get to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the U.S. American system, ,, in a little bit of my own story.
The French sign language came over in the 1800s, and with the time of the time, it's mixed with local signs, and the language that we now know about as ALS.
So it has a story about 200 years old.
I was born deaf . And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize it's not true for anything.
Sounds are a very important part of my life, they are really in my mind every day.
As a person who lives in a world of sounds, , is like I live in an foreign country, following their rules, computers, behaviors and rules without questioning them.
So how do I understand sound?
Well, people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my loudspeaker and they amplify sound.
Learning and copy that behavior.
At the same time, I learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people respond.
So I learned, for example.
\" Don't beaten the door! ''
\" Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag potato bag . ''
\" Don't mistakes ,"and when you're eating, you're going to do not to throw the covers on the dish . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I call this``sound tag . ''
Perhaps I think about the more of what the average person does.
I'm super surveillance.
And I'm always waiting with nervous sound, which is to come next.
So, this drawing.
TBP, to decide.
TBP, for continuing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
TBP ,.
You can see the screen has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through subtle and water boats.
In deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign for``spontaneous"at the at UCLA.
A typical score has five lines.
However, to me, to my thumb, it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as paint.
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different galleries, and as I was going from one place to another, , realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There was no visual art, everything was an audience.
Now the sound has entered my art territory.
Is it going to more than art?
I realized it doesn't have to be.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't just experience through the ears.
I can feel a tactile way, or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound property and put it into my artistic practice . . practice . .
And all that I had taught me in sound, , I decided to leave it and learn it.
I started creating a new work body.
And when I introduced it to the artistic community, ,, ,, ,, and attention.
I realized that sound is like money, power, control: social currency . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was an honest, , a . . .
And sound is so powerful that well, it could be demonstrated to me and my artistic work, , or I could be . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I picked up that I would be empowering.
There is massive culture around the spoken language . .
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to the eyes of society, it's like no voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me myself and become my voice.
That way I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, I work with many different performers of ALS.
And his voice becomes my voice and identity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They help me be being heard.
And their voices are value and weight . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Ironically, when I asked your voices to, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , as a loan of very high interest rate.
If I don't continue to go on with this practice, I feel that I could get away in oblivion and don't have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic, deep medium in the music world.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and Asland.
For example, a musical note can't capture and express it in paper . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And the same can be said from a concept in DSL.
The two are very speculative and highly modular, which means that subtle changes can affect all meaning as much as sound.
I'd like to share a metaphor of the piano, so that you understand the how the NSA works . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So, imagine a piano.
The NSA is split in many different weapon parameters . . .
If you add a different parameter for every finger while you play the piano, like facial expression, , body movement, speed, your hand form and so on, as the piano is playing, English is a linear language, as if it would be used just a key at once.
And yet, the NSA is more like an chord, , 10 fingers in a symbolic form to express a clear concept or idea in ALS.
If just a key to change the chord, it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in pitch, timbre and volume.
At UCLA, when you use these different grammar parameters, ,, different ideas.
For example, the``feature in that . ''
This is the``focus on that . ''
I'm seeing you.
And look at it.
Oh, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It was.
What are you looking at?
Ah ,! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So I got to think about, and if I look at NASA through the lens of music?
If you had to create a sign and repeated it over and over again, it could be a piece of visual music.
For instance, this is the sign of``day ,"the sun goes out and put it.
This is``all day . ''
If you repeat it and reduce speed, it visually looks like a musical piece.
All day.
I feel the same can say``all night . ''
\" All night . ''
This is all night in this drawing.
And this led me to about three different kinds of night: ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I feel the third has more music than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed at UCLA, and how the body distance can express changes in time.
For example, one of them is a hand . It's a hand, two of you . It's two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the, , ,'s in front of the body and the is in the back.
So the first example is,``long ago . ''
Then,``Older ,"and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at once,``There was once . ''
\" common time"is a musical term with a specific rate of four times per.
However, when I see the word``common time ,"I automatically think about the same time.
Look at TED: right hand, E . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We have the picture through the head and the chest . . .
[ Happy] [face] [Cat] [[, ., ,, , I'm going to show you a way of my hand called``fleank limb . ''
Can you do that?
Everyone with the hands.
Now we're going to do so much in your head as the chest, something like``common time ,"or``time . ''
Yes ,.
That means``love"in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and signs of signs around the world.
The second I'd like to show you is this . Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means``colonization"in the Asland.
Now, the third . Please give me back.
And again.
It's``illumination"at at UCLA.
We're going to do the three together.
\" Love ,"`` colonization"and``illumination . ''
Good job.
Notice how three signs are very similar . They all happen in head and chest, but they transmit very different meanings.
It's incredible to how the island is alive and thriving, like music.
But today, we live in a very Audience world.
And just because the NSA has no, ,, ,, automatically, has no social value . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We have to begin to start questioning what social value is and allow the USA to develop their own value ,.
And this could be to make a society more inclusive.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn Assan . learning.
The USA is a rich treasure and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, , open your eyes, to to participate in our our and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, you can just fall in love with us.
Thank you.
Deng Kahn: Hey.
As a child, my parents said,``You can take it all, but then you have to wipe it out . ''
Freedom involves responsibility . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence bubble or an ignorance bubble must say, because adults lie to protect us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, ,, that adults also teach and that they're not very good to clean each other.
The time happened, now I'm an adult, and I'm a citizen and I'm an invention and invention at Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we cleaned the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if you are, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these large pots and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to studying them under the microscope, , and we classify them and we collect this information in a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive, and it's also very risky to use those enormous boats.
So along with my students, with ages of six to 15, we were to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this mission of working work, so that children very low can also participate.
And I'll tell you, the kids who make electrical tools feel great and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collected plastic and we reduce the size that we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of their fragmentation.
That's what we do.
I let my students imagination.
My work is to try to take the the best ideas from every child and try to combine them into something that we hope for.
We decided instead of collecting chunks of plastic, we only collect information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this plastic -- the kids are excited with robots . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We then create what we call``a prototype . ''
We're so fast at in prototype creation that we ended before lunch.
And we transformed light bulbs and cameras in accessories, and we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the at to the to to start processing this image and measure the size of every particle, , to get an appropriate estimate of the amount of plastic in the water . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We documented this invention step in a website for inventors called``Interviewer, ,"with the hope that someone gets better.
What's great about this project is that students saw a, ,, ,, ,, . .
I can research my local problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
You see the news news, they get the Internet, and they came up with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning a oil spill, just using hands, in sub-Saharan, the largest largest blood rainforest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water you drink, it's water in which you're dancing, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You can also see that water is brown, the mud and oil is also brown to brown, and when it's all mixed, it's very hard to see what's in water.
But there's a simple technology called spectra, which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a spectroscope that can flow through all kinds of substances that produce different species, which can help to identify what's in the water.
We teams this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
What's really cool about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help shape other children.
[ I can investigate a distant problem] I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a harder problem, and also more close to me.
I am half Japanese and half French and you may remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that you have a variety of giant waves, called tsunami, and those those tsunami destroy several cities on the East Coast.
Over 14,000 people died in an instant.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant in Fukushima, a close to water.
And today, according to an average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the whole Pacific Ocean has pollution traces for 172.
If we go to the west coast, , we can measure Fukushima radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, , and most of the, it makes sure, it blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I went back to Fukushima every year from the accident and researching independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring kids.
Of course we didn't take them, parents didn't allow it.
But every night we reported the control center -- you see the use of different masks.
It might seem that they didn't take the work seriously, , but they did because they're going to have to live with radioactivity all their life.
And together with them we discussed the data collected that day and we talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the original, etc.
And to do this, we create a rudimentary map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the the lift map, we introduced pigment to represent data in real real time of radicalization, and we, and we can simulate rain.
And we could notice that the radioactive dust was filtering from the top of the mountain to the river system and deployed in the ocean.
It was an appropriate estimate . .
But based on this, we organize a civil expedition, the closest to nuclear central power . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We get closer to 1.5 miles from the nuclear central, and with the aid fishing aid, we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a sediment tracking as we invented and built.
So here's a progression: we've gone from a a a a a a.
And it has been very exciting to work in these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to doing all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit little, so, ,, ,, , and we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in Hong Kong's center, and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a, , basically, you can build almost everything there.
It also is a and children can play together.
It's a place where children's dreams can become reality with adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: acceleration! acceleration!
Now, to marry traces, we ask questions like, ,, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For instance.
Or can we help in the mobility of advanced age population transforming their standard wheelchair into new electric vehicles?
The plastic, oil and radioactivity are terrible legacy, but the worst legacy that we can leave our kids are lies.
We can't afford to protect children in the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent solutions.
So scientific citizens, creators, dreamer, we should prepare the next generation to worry about the environment and people, and so that it can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two twin domes, two radically opposite design cultures.
One is made from thousands of steel pieces, the other of a single silk thread.
One is synthetic, the other organic.
You care about the environment, the other.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the, in a bus, he saw a figure that fights for being free.
The prison was just a tool of Michelangelo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But the living ones are not climbed.
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we take all the information to do it for every cell to work and to replicate.
tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been mastered by registries of manufacturing and production.
The assembly lines have said a and built imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as associations of parts of different places with different functions.
But you don't find any shock material shared in nature.
Think about human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with dilate pores . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The skin skins are thicker with little pores.
You're acting mainly as filter, the other mostly as a barrier, and, though, is the same skin: there are no parts, there's no assembly.
It's a system that gradually vary their functionality by variation variation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Here's a dividing screen that represents my vision of the divided, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, the twice of and an architect to work currently between the, and the genocide and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthesis, , shows in the two screens after me.
My work, on its simplest level, ,, ,, is trying to unite these two visions in the world, getting away from the assembly and getting closer to growth . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
You probably wonder: Why now?
Why wasn't that possible about 10 or even five years ago?
We live in a very special moment in history, a, , where they have four disciplines that offers designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four fields, my team and I created.
Please know the minds and hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, , very scale, like this robotic arm with a 24 meters of diameter with a violent basis that some day not very distant, to print whole buildings, and gaps to nanoscale made of genetically modified microorganisms that shine in darkness.
Here we have reinvented the cellulose, an architect of ancient Arab architecture, ,, ,, ,, ,, , ,'s size to model light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a skirt . . Paracha, and it's like a second skin made from one piece, right in the contents, flexible around the waist.
Together with a 3D printing collaborator, we printed this layer and false 3D copies between cells . I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and white materials in 20 microns.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of an IT scanner . .
That designers have access to this ancient resolution and synthetic instruments, allows us to design products that are not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, a chair at the structure, comfortable and also absorbs sound . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Professor Carter, my collaborator, went back to nature to inspire us, and by designing this irregular surface pattern, it becomes a sensitivity.
We press this surface of 44 different properties, that vary in stiffness, opportunity and color, correspond to the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, like in nature, will vary its functionality not by addition to another material or another assembly, but vary continuously and clearly the material property.
But is it ideal nature?
Are there parts of nature?
I wasn't raised in a Jewish Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about Hebrew Bible, ,, ,, , and I got to define a lot that matters.
Like she,``In the third day of creation, God sends Earth to grow a fruit fruit of fruit . ''
For that first fruit tree, there would be no no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and fruits . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the Earth did grow trees with branches, ,, ,, streets and flowers . .
The Earth created a.
I often ask myself,``What would the design be if objects would make a single piece?
Would we come back to a better state of creation? ''
So we looked for that the biblical material, the kind of material tree with fruits, and we found it.
The second most abundant biomimicry on the planet is called the resistance, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , every year by organisms, crabs, scorpions and butterflies.
We think that if we could synthesize their properties, we could generate cultural structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal shellfish ., we asked them to a lot of shrimp, we fly them, and we produced shot pie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Water the chemical concentrations, we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and opaque, to light, soft and transparent.
To print the structures at large scale, it became a system with multiple borers of extrinsic controlled extraction.
The robot was able to vary the properties of material on the march and create these structures made from one material 3.5 feet long , 100 percent recyclable.
When pieces are ready, they let them dry to find a natural form to contact the air.
So why do we keep designing plastic?
The air bubbles that were an impression of the printing process was used to contain photographic microorganisms that appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at at Harvard and MIT, we embedded the bacteria designed genetically to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that do their transition without problems of coming back to mesh, and if it's even more, window.
A fruits of fruit loaded.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp masks in an architecture that behaves as a tree . .
And here's the the best part: for objects designed to biodegrade, put in the sea, feed marine life, and put on the ground, will help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same principles of design was solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for intercontinue journeys.
To do that, we should dominate bacteria and control their flow.
So like the periodic board, we made our own elements: :, new forms of life created computer, , engineered form and augmented in biological form.
I like to think of synthetic biology as liquid alchemy, just that instead of carrying precious metals, , new biological functionality within very small channels.
This field is called microblogging.
We printed our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops bacterial crops . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In our first piece of clothing, two microorganisms were combined.
The first is the science.
He lives in our oceans and in freshwater.
And the second, E. coli, the bacteria that inhabit in the human gut.
It turns light in sugar, the other sugar consumption and produce useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms don't interact in nature . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In fact, they never met.
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a a relationship.
Think about it as evolution, not natural selection, but design evolution.
To contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the digestive tract, that will help flow these bacteria, and they get their way out.
So we started growing those channels in the human body, looking at the properties of material according to the desired functionality.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, we would have more transparent channels.
This portable digestive system, , when you stretch one end to another , 20 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our delicate intestine . . . . . . . . . .
And here's a, ,, our first profound photosynthesis, brilliant liquid channels with life within clothes.
Thank you.
Mary Shell said, ,, ,, ,, , only half it.
What if design would provide the other half?
What if we could create structures that increase living material?.
And if we could create personal microbes that would scan our skin, they'd repair the damaged tissue and hold our bodies?
Think about this as a way to edit biology.
I call this material ecology.
For that, you always have to back to nature.
So you know that a 3D printer printed material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it.
It grows . It adds to sophistication.
This worm of the worm, for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home within which it metaphorically . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Now manufacturing doesn't add to this level of sophistication.
It does it by combining not two materials, but two proteins in different concentrations.
An act as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, putting those fibers into each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first is presented in the environment, creates a tension structure, and then it starts to thread a cocoon of compression.
The tension and understanding, the two forces of life, they manifest in one material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we put a little magnet to the head of a silk worm, to the ice.
We put it into a, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of the worm worm worm . .
And yet, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch, not within a box, we realized that it would align a flat glass and still metaphorical.
So we started designing different environments, different scaffolding, and found that the shape, the composition, the structure of the cocoon, is transmitted directly by the environment.
You often have silk worms, to death within your cocoon, your silk goes down and used in the textile industry . .
We saw that designing these plants, we can shape the raw silk without producing a single cocoon.
They're going to be motivated, and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process to architectural scale.
We had a ice robot doing silk plants, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We knew that silk worms migrate towards darker and cold areas, so we use a to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or abstractions, to block the rays of light and heat, , streams about structure.
We were prepared to get to the caterpillars . . . . . . .
We asked 65,000 silk worms to a online farm farm.
And after you feed them four weeks, they were prepared with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the scaffolding, and as they did, they raised, they were displaced, they put eggs, and life starts again, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and was right.
At the top biological silk on the ice silk, they give all this piece of their integrity.
And in a little over two or three weeks , 5,000 silk worms take 5,000 miles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
Pollen, after the echolocation, produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra panels in the future . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk ice through a, . .
If the the last frontier of design is to give life to products and buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers must join these two visions in the world.
Which brings us back, of course, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Here is a new design age, a new belief of creation, that leads us from a design inspired in nature to an inspired nature in design, ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Thank you.
Thank you very much . Thanks.
Hands up if you've ever asked you,``What do you want to be? ''
If they had to remember how old they had when they first asked them????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
You can show it with fingers.
Three . Five . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Now, raise your hand if the question,``What do you want to be? ''
It's caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question,``What do you want to be? ''
The problem wasn't that I had any interest, but I had too much.
In school, I liked English, the materials and art and developing websites, ,, played the guitar in a song called Teles frustrated.
Maybe you heard about us.
And in general me, I like to try and pursue anyway, , for having spent a and and sometimes money in this field . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But over time, this sense of boredom, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to get to me.
And I have to leave it.
But then I'm interested with something else, , totally different, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And finally, I.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go on that.
This pattern caused me a lot anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to convert this into a career.
I thought I should choose one thing, deny all my other passions, and rescue me to bored me.
Another reason why I was so anxious was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something bad about this, , and something wrong with me not not to define anything.
I was worried about having fear of compromise, or being dispersed, or to cultural or my own success.
If you can relate my story, and these feelings, , I'd like to ask you something I'd like to have planned.
Ask themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where you learned it: you learned about culture.
We're wondering first,``What do you want to be? ''
It's when we're five.
And the truth is that nobody cares what you answer that age.
It's considered a naive question to develop nice responses in kids like, ,, ,, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Try to make Hollywood enjoy here.
So this question is done over and over again as we grow up different shapes, P, to high school students are asked you to choose in university.
And at some point,``What do you want to be? ''
It's from being the cute exercise of earlier to what you take away your dream.
Why?
If this question inspired kids to dream with what they might be, it doesn't inspire to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though you're well-intentioned adults, and you might be laughing and say,``Oh, what nice, but you can't be an artisan of violent and psychologist.
You have to choose . ''
This is Dr. Bob Chile, and he, and he's artistic of violent and psychiatric.
And this Amy Ng, , a magazine, converted in illusion, business, and creative director.
But most children don't hear talking about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of focused life is very idealized in our culture . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's this idea of the fate or the the real vocation, the idea that each one of one of us has something to do for their time in this land, ,, ,, , and to devote their life.
But what if you're somebody who is not connected in this way? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What if there are many different themes that wake up their curiosity and many different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that frame . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So you can feel just.
You can feel it doesn't have an objective.
And feel there's something wrong with one.
There's no bad at.
You're a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A crowd is somebody with many interests and creative activities . . .
It's a.
It could help if it divides in three parts: multiple, potential and day.
You can also use other terms that you've got the same idea, as a radio, a Renaissance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
During the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was good at multiple disciplines.
Barbara Shererro refers to us as``scanners . ''
They use any term you like or invent yourself.
It seems like a kind of adapting to a community, we can't agree with an identity.
It's easy to see vulnerability as limitation or feedback that you should beat.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in being this way . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Here are three multi-property superpowers.
One: synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the intersection.
Now, John Higgsoin and Rachel Bink expressed his interests shared in cartography, visualization of data, travel, mathematicians, mathematicians and design, by founding Bush.
Bush is a company that creates inspired jewelry jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry . jewelry.
The Shah and Rachel came up with this single idea for its eclectic mixture of skills and experiences . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Innovation happens in intersections.
That's where new ideas occur.
And the crowds, with all their backgrounds, can access to a lot of these points of intersection.
The second cultural superpower is fast learning.
When Muslims are interested in something, we go to it.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We're wired to be beginners, for having been many times in the past, and this means that we're less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort zones.
A lot of skills are transferred to other disciplines, and we bring all that we've learned to every new area that we're chasing, so we rarely start from zero.
North Dublin is a full-time journey and an independent journey.
As a pianist girl, they perfected an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the most quickly known marketing . . . . . . . . .
Before becoming a writer, North was a financial planner.
He had to learn the most thin sales of sales when he started their practices, , helps write compelling spears for publishers.
It rarely is a loss of time to get to what you're attracted to, even if I finally abandoned it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have predicted . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The third cultural superpower is adaptability . . . . . . . . . . .
Abed Cochrane is sometimes director of videos, other, website designer, sometimes contemporary of Kickstarter, sometimes teachers, and sometimes apparently, James Bond.
It's valuable because it makes good work.
He's even more valuable because he can take up different roles, depending on the needs of their customers.
The East Company magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability to develop in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and unpredictable that are the individuals and organizations that can spread to satisfy the needs of the market, the ones that really thrive.
synthesis of ideas, rapid learning and adaptability: three abilities where crowds are very adept, , and three skills that could be lost if they're ready to reducing their goals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
As a society, we have a great interest to foster the crowds that are themselves.
We have complex problems, multi-seawer right now, and we need not conventional creative thinkers to cope with them.
Let say they are, in their heart, specialists.
They came out of the, knowing that they wanted to be pediatric neurosurgeon.
You don't worry, there's nothing bad in you either.
In fact, some of the best teams are made from a specialist and a multi-property . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The specialist can dive deep and put to practice ideas, and multiply offers an amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But we should all design lives and careers that harmony the way we're connected.
And unfortunately, it's in the crowds that are largely encouraged to just be more like their specialized companions.
I once said this, if there's one thing you're going to get from this talk, I, :, whatever.
If you're a heart specialist, then special for all media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the multi-the in the room, including those who just realized to be one of them in the last 12 minutes, I tell you, it reconciliation with their many passions.
They follow their curiosity for these rabbits.
explore the intersections.
embracing our inner wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps the most important, multi-property, the needs.
Thank you.
In the year 101, a woman named Augusten took a in France . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I was failing, and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
His doctor called Alaska.
Now, Alaska didn't know how to help Aurora, but I flew out, until unfortunately, he failed in 1906.
After his death, Alaska did a autopsy, and they found strange, oxygen plates in the Duke brain, of a, never seen before.
The most surprising thing.
If anybody had been alive today, we couldn't give it more help than Alaska gave him 14 years ago.
Alaska was Dr. Alan Alzheimer.
And African Deteron, the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since 1991, medicine has advanced much.
antibiotics and vaccines have been discovered to protect us from infections, a lot of treatments for cancer, anti-companies for HIV, states for Carts and much more.
But a little bit of progress in Alzheimer's treatment.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affecting 40 million around the world.
But in 2050, it will affect 150 million to, by the way, include many of you.
If you wait to live up to age 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's contract will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there's the probability that they spend their golden years with Alzheimer or helped to take care of a friend or be to be loved Alzheimer.
In the U.S. alone, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease, and their costs provide an increase in five times in 2050, as they age the generation of the boom.
They may be surprised, ,, ,, , but Alzheimer's most medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively long to fight it.
Today, one of the 10 of the 10 death causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's only one that can't prevent or cure or even related their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer Alzheimer, because we've invested less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in Cancer's research that at Alzheimer's despite the fact that Alzheimer's costs is, and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause: . .
Because this is what a few people know, but everyone should: Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the last 14 years, everybody, even scientists, confused Alzheimer's aging.
We think it's going to be sensitive in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just have to look at a picture of a healthy brain, compared to a patient of Alzheimer's patient to see real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to a severe loss of mental memory and abilities, damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's hopes significantly reduces life and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer found plates and strangers and strangers in the African brain a century ago.
For nearly a century, , we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they are made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that's being folded as an origami.
There are places in paper that are sticky . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And when it folds well, , these sticky dots ends end.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky dots are left on the outside . . . .
This makes protein molecules paste each other, forming groups that can form large plates and sheep.
That's what we see in the patient's brain with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this dysfunction works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like developing a bomb.
Cortex a cable could do anything.
It can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that blocked it, and then create a drug that I do.
Until recently, in the most part, the wires have reduced and waited for the best.
But now there's a, doctors, biologists, geneticist, chemicals, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process . Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that blocked specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
Nobody outside our lab has yet seen.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in worms.
These are the healthy worms, and you can see that you move with normal.
These worms, on the other hand, have protein molecules that paste each other within them, like humans with Alzheimer.
And you can see you're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that they heal and live a normal life.
This is just a positive result, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After 14 years of waiting, there's real hope hope that can be achieved in the next 10 or 20.
But to grow up that hope, to beat Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not scientists like me ,.
We must understand that Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and if we try it, we can beat it.
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have gotten more research and exert pressure about governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and legislators.
That was essential to advance in HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit unit for cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, , the hidden victims, the caregivers of their beings loved day and night, they are often too much desperate to go out and advocate.
So, really depends on you.
Alzheimer's not, in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain running the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like August, who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They help talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article at at the New York Times column in January this year.
To love someone, do this.
The article is a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience by testing myself one night from past summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers are transparent to ask 36 and more personal questions, and then both of them are looking at the eyes without speaking for four minutes.
So here's a couple of questions.
Number 12: : If you could wake tomorrow with a quality or ability, what would it be?
Number 28: When was the last time you cried to another person?
And just?
As it goes forward, these are increasingly personal.
Number 30 :...This really, I like -- tell your partner, what you get from him or it, and I didn't tell this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to somebody you've ever known . . . . . . . .
When I stumbled with this study a few years ago, a detail really called me the attention, the joke that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to ceremony.
So, it was skeptical about this process of making romantic love, but certainly it was also intrigued.
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone who knew not not not not particularly well, , I didn't expect to fall.
However, we fell in love with it, and I thought it was a, , so I sent it to the the modern love a few months later.
That was published in January, and now is August, so I guess some of you probably wonder: Do they follow together?
And the reason I think you're questioning this is because you've done this question over and over over the last seven months.
And from this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
One week before the article was published, I was very nervous . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I had been working on a in the last few years, so, I writing about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entrance can come to a few hundreds of views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and image that my article in New York Times would achieve probably a few thousands of views.
And that made a good attention charge in a relatively new relationship.
But as it gave, I had no idea.
The article released online a Friday at night, and the Saturday, this happened in my blog traffic.
And the Sunday, they had been called me the Ted Show and the American Morricade America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America . America.
In one month, the article received over eight million views, and I was, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One is to foster trust writing with simplicity about themselves, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news and that people around the world are really interested in your new relationship.
And when people call or write, what they did every day for weeks, they always asked the same question: Still they still follow?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick quest in my email in my email with the phrase:``Still follow? ''
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and from corporate strangers like this . . . . . . .
I was interviewed in the radio and asked him.
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed to the stage,``Hey Mandela where is your boyfriend? ''
And I immediately put it red.
I understand that this is part of the treatment.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the adventure.
The 36 questions seemed to have changed life life.
In fact, the New York Times published a complementary article for San Vanier, ,, who included readers of readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first pulse for all this attention was to be very reserved with my own relationship.
I said not every request that we're both going to make a public emergence.
I downloaded television interviews, and they cut out the photos of of us.
I think I was afraid that I was afraid to turn into the inanimate icons of the love process, a range of the I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,.
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and it felt like, especially, people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if we were together or not, and also tell?
So if the answer was not, would the experience to do these 36 less interesting questions? questions?.
Dr. Arthur Aron wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997 . . love.
Instead of that, I was looking for international performance between university students, using what Aron called sustainable, progressive and reciprocal personal openness.
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study does.
The participants felt closer after doing it, several foreign studies also used the Amazon Protocell Protocell protocol as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of police and community, and they've used it among people of opposite political ideologies.
The original version of history, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was quoted in this article, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came to me and said to me,``I tried the study and didn't work . ''
He seemed puzzling for it.
And I: Do you mean you fall in love from the person who you did?
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants us to friends.
And me, but became better friends?
Do you feel that you could know better after testing the study?
The seat.
So, it worked ,"I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled up with the study for the first time when I was 29 and was taking a really hard separation.
I had that relationship since I had 20, which was pretty much all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So I flew in science.
So I investigate everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I hope that it could sort of vaccinate the heart . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I don't know if I realized this at at the time I just research for the book that I wrote, but in retrospect, it seems really obvious.
I thought, if I was bored with the knowledge of romantic love, ,, , I would never have to feel as bad and used to myself.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one or another.
I'm more patient with love . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I have more confidence to demanding what I look for.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than you can tell me.
What I look for love is a guarantee, not just being loved today and being loved tomorrow, but to keep being loved by the person I love.
It may be that this is the the deck that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to love.
There can be a way to some way to mitigate something from implicit risk, and this is a very attractive story, because it makes us feel wonderfully, but it's also frightening . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that you ask question: still follow together?
And his content with an answer of whether or no.
So more than a question, to propose that we ask questions more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How do you stay in love when things are complicated, and how to know when to cut and distance?
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably delivers a relationship? Or even more, how do you live in your partner doubt?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to having a a, what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of the history of of my relationship, it's this -- a year ago, a met, and we applied a study designed to create romantic love, we fall in love, we still follow together, and I'm very happy.
But love is not the same as to stay in love.
So love is the easy part.
So at the end of my article, I wrote: Love didn't happen . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We stay in love because we took the choice to be.
And I am a little bit of thinking when you read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, ,, , I hadn't considered everything that was supposed.
I don't consider how many times we would have both to make that decision, and the time you have to keep doing that choice without knowing before it will always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, have chosen to love someone as generous, nice and fun and have expressed that choice in the larger in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to convert my relationship in the kind of that I don't really think.
And what I look for, and what I might spend my life looking for is that myth is true.
I want the the Happy implication to the title of my article, which is, in purpose, the only part of the article that actually didn't write.
But what I have instead is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and hope that he will also love me, and it's frightening, but that is the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few tiles in full mountain, and in a way, I got a forest of the forest.
It's something that really affected me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight.
I took a wooden box, , and it a dollar bill, a, , somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange humans or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and learn how our species exchange ideas, for example how we eat spaghetti.
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's because there I am , 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a given time, I was in Hawaii -- I like to go undercover and make surfing and all these weird things -- and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary, and I threw up all the pages and made a sort of cell cells to the style Agnes Martin, the resin covered and a bee was caught.
Well, my mother has fear to fear, and it's allergic to them, so I added more resin on canvas, thinking I could hide it.
Instead, the opposite thing happened: somehow it was like that it increased size, like you look at the text with a magnifying magnifying.
So I did? I built more boxes.
And this time, , I started adding electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I'd find on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to relate them and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow strokes, draw just like it around a chain on the scene scene.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens.
First, botanical -- that you can make an idea.
Then I made a few insects and strange creatures.
It was very fun to draw in resin layers.
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and those things, ,, ,, ,, ,, for example, going to Lizzie.
It was great.
At some moment, I'm interested in human form, ,, natural size sculptures with drawings of human beings within layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I die.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing in a window, then in another window, and another window, and had all these windows together that were formed a three-dimensional composition.
And this really works, , and I could stop using resin.
So I did this for years, and my work lungs with something very large, which I call``traumatic . ''
For the``Truth"inspired me in a large measure in the``The Garden of Discipline ,"which is a painting on the Museum in Spain in Spain.
You know it?
Well it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a bit ahead of your time.
Well,``Trip ."explain this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
Five meters long . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It has double face, so 10 meters of composition.
It's a little strange.
Well, that's the source source.
On the left, there's Jesus and the . .
There's a cave where all these animals with animals travel between two worlds.
They're going from the world of representation, to this analog of analog mesh where they hid.
Here is where the creatures with heads of animals are headed to the face, ready to suicide in mass in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
This is a bird god attached to a cliff . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Billy Graham is in the sea; the horizon -- the oil platform of the World syndrome, the refugee of Osama Bin Laden, ,, ,, ,, ,, , ,.
So anyway, also a kind of mushrooms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's coming out of the ocean, and I spit oil oil in a hand while in the other hand, clouds come out.
Your hands are like balance and looks like a mythological being that keeps Earth and cosmos in balance.
So it's a``traumatic . ''
It's a little bit a narrative.
That's the hand that I choose.
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a trumpet, like a bird summit, and wrong clouds of this trap.
It also has a 5.5 meters long a, which unites the``traumatic . ''
Anyway, his tail shows fire by the way on a volcano.
I don't know why that happened.
Things that happen, you know.
His tail ends up in an academic school balloon made of terrorist cards in 1986.
Have you seen?
They were done in the 1980, as if they were baseball drivers.
It takes me to my last project . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I'm in the middle of two projects: One is called``psychologists . ''
It's a six-year-old project to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, , through media and material whether they're encyclopedia, dictionaries or journals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But each one acts as a kind of an archive in ways of being human, and travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they collect, they divide.
And you can walk between them . It's taking me years.
Each one is basically a microscope behavior that weighs 1,300 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the head; . It's the chest, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I'll be accompanied by the the rest of the body: there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers your penis or no non-specific, or whatever you have, a kind of an amazing thing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's a quick shot of these works because I can't explain for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a broken body by half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between two.
There are a few pills that go out and enter the head of this strange statue.
There's a little forest scene within the Toronto cavity . .
Can you see it?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's a brick box; . .
Within this box there is a physicist, a, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, a museum, an editorial arm that spread all the content we do in the world.
We wiggle the box, and all of the people in the middle with each other as particles.
And I think that's how changing the world.
When you're reading who it is and the box that it's living.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , doesn't work.
We're all really made of the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and genetically we're going to die very soon.
Thank you.
What do you do when you put your head?
They take an aspirin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the intestines and other organs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's going to take a pill that's the most effective and pain system for any fancy drug in the body.
The downside, however, , is that when you bring it any medicine, it's going on.
And this is a big problem, with HIV.
When they take antiretroviral drugs, they serve to decrease the amount of viruses in blood, and increase the contemporary of CEO cells.
But they're also known for their adverse side effect, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, in the time they tend to get to your destination, which is where it's more important: in the.
These are regions of the body as the lymph lymph nodes, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is innocent and doesn't easily enter the blood tower of the patients that are subjected to regular drugs with antiretroviral drugs.
But after the treatment of treatment, viruses can awaken and infect new blood cells.
This is the great treatment of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is an adult life treatment of an oral life . . . . .
One day, I sat down and I thought,``Could we get the treatment directly to the warehouse of, without the risk of discipline of drugs? ''
As a scientific expert in laser, ,, ,: ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If you use in dentistry, for care of wounds and surgery, you can use for anything imaginable, including the extracellular transport of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill, extremely small holes, and they open up, almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best they say,``How is that possible? ''
We send a little bit and powerful laser on the member of the cellular membrane, while these cells are immersed in a liquid liquid.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in terms of microseconds.
Before I even realized, the hole is immediately repaired . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We're currently testing this technology in vitro or in Petri's plates, but the goal is to to bring this technology into the human body, apply to the human body.
\" How is that possible?"you can ask questions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Well the answer is, through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our our laser, we'll make an incisions on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is headed to the.
Finally, the third head, an injection that distributes the drug, releases it directly into the infection site, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open . . . . . .
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of the body of the body.
Yeah . A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all HIV research -- in our case, a treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment . treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I, I've been studying non-state armed organizations: organizations like terrorists, insurgents or military.
document what these groups do when they're not shooting.
My goal is to understand better to these genes of violence and study ways to encouraging violence of violent participation to nonviolent confrontation.
I do field work, in the world of politics and in library.
Understanding these groups is key to solve nearly conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
No longer.
Now it's a conflict between states and activists.
For instance, of the 2616 peace agreement between 1975 and 2011, ,, , and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these groups; even we should engage or defeat them in any resolution of successful conflict resolution . .
But how do we do it????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know the reason that they fight, how they do it, but no one analyzed what they do when they don't fight.
The armed struggle and policies don't armed.
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less to defeat them without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For instance, the Lebanon, known by its violent cooling against Israel . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
From his creation in the 1980, in 1980, he has also established a political game, a social services and device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian, known by their suicide attacks against Israel, , Arabic Gail since 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
They are multitasking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
They established a complex communication machinery: radio stations, TV channels, Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the ISIS magazine, printed English and published to recruit.
armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising fundraising, but by profitable business -- for example, building companies . .
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, , increase their funds, to better and build their brand.
armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they build hospitals, they're putting to make professional formation programs or microfinance training programs.
Now he offers all these services and more.
armed groups also try to conquer population, offering something that the state is not not giving: security and protection . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The ascent of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn of war, or even the beginning of the island of ISIS, can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, , security has an unfortunate price for population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a vacuum, a gap left by government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electronic victory of 2006 of the Palestinian Hans can't understand the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario, , even in the West, when we analyzed armed groups, we just think of the violent side.
But that is not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the in the long term.
These groups are hybrid . . . . . . . .
They grow because they fill gaps left by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups, participate in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated are these organizations, the less we can calculate them as something opposite to a state.
How do you call a?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
They mastered part of a territory, ,, they manage all their functions, they collect the trash, they manage the acceleration system.
Is it a state? Is a rebel group?
Or maybe it's something else, , something new and different.
What is ISIS?
The lines are distributed.
We live in a world of states, of without states and hybrids, and the more weak states are, like in the the Middle East, more intervene and fill that gap, not government actors . .
This is important for governments, because to contrast to these groups will have to invest more in not military tools.
filling that government of government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach . .
This is very important to establish and make peace.
If we understand the armed groups, we will understand better how incentives to offer to foster violence of violence to nonviolence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, military power can win some battles, but it will not give us peace or stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security void, to filling that government of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My views about gender equality are vertically, ,, , but I fear to accept openly the tag of``feminist"would be unfair for feminists.
I'm feminist, but pretty bad.
And so I'm self-assemble as a weed.
Or at, at least, I wrote an article, and a book called``The Bad feminist ,"and then in interviews, people started calling me the Member Member.
So what started as a personal joke devoted to myself and a deliberate proposition, has become something larger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth, and at 20, I had strange ideas about feminist feminist, , these wider women, angry with men and hated sex . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people when people would keep innovating that could be feminist.
Being tagged as a feminist was an accusation, a taboo and a nasty word.
I was tagged as a, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Nobody wants to be that rebels, until he realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine to be another person.
Over time, as I went growing, I began to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also, proud of being.
For me, certain claims are irrational: , women.
We deserve the same land for the same work . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We have right to travel around the world as we want, free of harassment or violence.
We have right to use easily and accessible contraceptives and reproductive services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without need for legislative control or elderly doctrines.
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about women's needs, you have to have our other identities.
We're not alone.
We are people with a different body, gender expression, religion and sexuality, social condition, skills and more.
We have to have in account of these differences and how they affect us, in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of inclusion, , our feminism is nothing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
For me, these truths are evidence, but to be clear: : . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I'm full of contradictions.
There are lots of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, ,, I rap music, I'm hearing everything volume.
Although the letter degrade to women and offends me deeply, the classic``Salt Shakespeare ,"from the High Canyon Twin is incredible . . . .
\" Make it true with your wet t-shirt.
Dogs, give it, , ,!! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Think about it.
pure poetry, right?
I'm completely mortified by my musical liking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, including -- all the domestic tasks, but also killing insects, the garbage collection, the care and the machine maintenance.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
I enjoy fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see``The Black"and the Romantic comedy, ,, ,, ,, , ,.
Some of my crimes are thinner.
If a woman wants to adopt his husband's loss, it's his choice, , and I'm not to judge.
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her kids, ,, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, , the problem is that our society is confused in a way that makes women economically vulnerable when they choose.
We'll solve this problem.
It recognizes conventional Feminism that has ignored or developed historically the needs of color women, workers, homosexual and transgendered, in favor of white, heart, middle-class women.
Listen, if that's good feminist, I'm a very bad feminist.
The following: as feminist, I feel a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

We hope you're looking at perfection.
When we're disappointed, , we would pull them a lot of like the same pedal where we put them.
Now, as I said, I am a disaster; I think I'm getting rid of that pedal before they try to put me there.
Too many women, particularly the innovators and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as feminist.
They're afraid to stand up and say, ,``Yeah, ,, ,"by fear of what that tag means, by fear, not to be able to meet with a little bit of really realistic expectations.
Take for example to Beijing, or as I call it, the God.
Over the last few years, it a declared feminist . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In the Arabic Museum , 2014, in MTV, acting in front of the word``feminist"by three meters tall.
It was a magnificent show, , seeing this star star opening openly the feminism and making women and young men to be feminist is something to be proud.
The time, the cultural critics started arguments, whether Benki was or not just feminist.
They rating its feminism, ,, ,, ,, ,, adult woman ,.
We demand perfection of feminist, because we're still fighting a lot, we want a lot, we need so much.
We're going far beyond the sensible and constructive criticism, to address any woman's feminism, to describe it until it nothing left . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point.
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our imperfections to realize, to action and being a little more courageous.
If I listen to degrade music, ,, ,, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happily providing an unlimited supply.
These artists won't change their way of to talk about women in their songs until we take the change affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so glue?
It's hard to choosing something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions are justify that makes it harder for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my niece, three and four years.
It's two magnificent, determined, brilliant girls, and also very brave . . .
It's where the strong creatures are appreciated.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option is viruses as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a the sexual violence against women as sport, to the throne of Troy.
We can change radio emissions when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to film elsewhere when movies don't treat women more than decorative objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their partners as a boxing.
In any case, men, especially white men, healthy men can say,``No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to participate to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your publication, or your organization is more inclusive with a larger range of people . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ''
Those of us who are underestimated, but invited to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also deny to being included until more as us are welcome to overcome the barriers to decision.
Because we're not a lot of money, without these efforts, without adopting these positions, our accomplishments will mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions come to top, people in the directors and filmmakers and music producers, CEOs, the legislators, people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting and meaningful change.
We can also claim with our feminism, good, bad, or whatever.
The last line of my book``Bad Member ,"says,``Would you want to be to a bad feminist to not be at all . ''
This is true because of a lot of reasons, ,, ,, ,, ,, because my voice was stolen, and the feminism helped me.
There was an incident.
I call it incident to cope what happened.
There are a few boys to me when I was very young, , and I didn't know that kids can do this to a . . . . . .
I was treated like nothing.
I started thinking it was nothing.
They stole my voice, and after all I don't dare to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But -- was writing.
And I came back to write.
I'm reminded in a a . . .
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understand what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started thinking that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if it a little brave, another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the anything that the world tries to tell us we are.
In one hand, I to achieve anything.
And in the other, , I hold the human reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I, ,, ,, ,, , I'm trying to better thinking, what I'm saying and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope we can all be a bit brave, ,, , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Right after Christmas last year , 13 children in California had measles to have seen Disneyland or to being exposed to someone who had been there . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The virus then went through the border with Canada, infected over 100 children in Quebec . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So one of the tragic things about this outbreak is that measles that can be fatal for a child with a weakened immune system, is one of the easiest diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century, but many of the kids involved in the Disney outbreak had hadn't been vaccinated because their parents were afraid even worse: autism . .
But a moment, wasn't the the the article that unleashed the police of autism and discussions and vaccines and disappointed and marked for being a fracture that was deliberate by the British Medical Journal??.
Isn't the most intelligent scientists that the theory that vaccines cause autism is a stupidity?
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world remain fearing that vaccines are going to get in danger with their children to autism.
Why?
So here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of the autism of autism over time . . .
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very bizarre disease . . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness . illness.
The few psychologists and pediatrician that I had heard about it believed to develop all of their professional lives without seeing one case.
For decades, prevalence estimates followed only three or four children per 10,000.
But then in the '90s, the numbers started shooting.
The funding organizations of funding as autism Sachs are directly referred to autism as an epidemic, as if I could get another child in Disneyland . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What's going on?
If not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Centers of Disease Control Center, what's going on, tend to based on phrases like``blocked diagnostic criteria"and``a better case detection ,"to explain these growing figures.
But that kind of language doesn't have a lot a lot of the fears of a young mother who looks for the face of his two-year-old son, the visual contact.
If diagnostic criteria had to expand, why were they so reduced at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the '90s?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions . .
I learned that what happened has less than to do with slow and cautious progress of the science that the service of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be false, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact in global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost lost and forgotten in the dark corners of clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist, Kenyan, , Johnson Hospital, in 1993, Kenya published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to to inhabit private worlds, not people around them, even their parents.
They could be fun for hours by hitting their hands to their faces, but they were a prisoner of the panic, like when they didn't get their favorite toy in their wild place without knowing them.
Over the base of patients who are treated in their clinic, Kanever that autism is very rare.
By the year of 1950, as a leading authority of the world in the subject, I would say that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome while I record of places like South Africa . . . . . . . . . .
This is actually not surprising, because the healing criteria for autism diagnosis were very restrictive.
For example, I would give that diagnosis to kids with convictions, but we now know that epilepsy is very common in autism . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Once he realized that he had turned to nine from every 10 children sent by other doctors to his consumer for being autistic without giving them a . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Kanzi was a smart man, ,, , . theories.
It classified autism as a form of child psychosis caused by cold and discarded parents . . parents . .
These kids, he said, they have been kept carefully in a refrigerator that not definition.
At the same time, though, Warner noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that clustering in certain areas like music, mathematicians and memory.
One of the kids in his clinic could distinguish between 18 symphonies before they would get two.
When her mother put one of his favorite records, , he said,``Beethoven . ''
But 1991 had a, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , ,.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, in invisible world.
Surprisingly, it wasn't until the was until the 1970s that researchers started testing the Ministry theory that autism was weird.
London Winst, cognitive psychologist in London, ,, ,, was a lot of stupid mothers in Kenya was pretty stupid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
She and his husband John were warm and affectionate people, and they had a deep autistic daughter called Sussian . .
Lorraine and John knew how hard to raising a girl like Susie without any support of support, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, London and his colleague John Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They did a study of autism prevalence in general population.
They pioneered a London suburb called Cambridge to try to find the autistic kids in the community . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What you saw left that the Warner model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.
Some kids couldn't talk at at all, whereas others were cooled in their fascination for astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the genetics.
In another way, these kids didn't fit in beautiful and blocks, as John said, and saw a lot of them, much more than the monkey's monolithic model would have predicted.
At the beginning, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
How did no one have not noticed these children before?
But then London found a reference to an article that was published in German in 1941, the next year to Kenya's article, ,, ,, ,, , to a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
Kanzi knew about this article of competition, ,, ,, ,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There wasn't even an English translation, but luckily, the Lawrence was talking German, and he translated it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man called Hans Asperger, ,, ,, an integrated school with an internal school in Vienna in the 1930s . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The ideas of Asperger for teaching children with learning differences were even progressive for contemporary standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards . standards
The morning in his clinic started with music classes, ,, and kids follow their games on Sunday afternoon . . . . . .
Instead of blame to the parents of causing autism, Asperger described it as as a political disability of life that requires compassionate forms of support and spaces that are adapted during the course.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, ,, ,, Apple calls them their little teachers, and he dedicated to help the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
And fundamentally, Asperger saw autism as a diverse continuum that had an amazing variety of gifts and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in architects known in pop culture as the social scientist, the destroyed teacher.
He was beyond even saying, that for success in science and art, a piece of autism is essential.
Larry and Judith discovered that Kenya was wrong in the that autism was an infection, so the parents were the causes.
In the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of psychiatry to expanding the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called autistic spectrum.
In the late 1980s and early '90s, their changes went into flight, holding the limited model of Kenya by one wide and inclusive.
These changes didn't fall in broken.
Now, when London and Judith worked between trash to reform these criteria, people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out,``Rain Man"in 1988, just a little circle, funded by experts knew what autism was, but after the incredible actor of Dusty Hoffman like Raylen Babbage and the recognition of``Rain Man"with four origamins of academia, peripers, psychologists, teachers and parents around the world knew what autism was.
At the same time, the first, the first easy clinical trials to using autism.
I should no longer have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The combination of``Rain Man"changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network effect, a perfect storm of the awareness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to elevate, ,, ,, and, in fact, they hoped that it was, getting people to autism, and their families finally got the support and services they deserved.
So Andrew Wachter came to blame vaccines for the increase in diagnostics, a simple, powerful, and shelter credible history, credible history as the theory of Kane that autism was inefficient.
Now, if the current estimate of the prevention center that one in 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the largest minority groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined on the Internet to refuse the idea that the puzzles are to solve for the new medical advances, actually coined the term``neurogenesis"to celebrating the strains of human cognition . .
A way to understand neurogenesis is to think of terms of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows, ,, doesn't mean it's broken.
According to autistic standards, the normal human brain is easily miserable, social, and suffers from an attention to details.
Definitely, autistic people have difficulty to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching Asperger, which believed that the``cure"for the most unintended aspects of autism are in understanding of teachers, ,, ,, ,, ,, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named biotechnology Zacarias, once said,``We need all the hands in cover to get the ship of humanity . ''
As we browse to an uncertain future, ,, ,, ,, ,, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to cope the challenges that we face face.
We can't afford waste or a brain.
Thank you.
